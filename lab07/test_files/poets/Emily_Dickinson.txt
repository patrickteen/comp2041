"Arcturus" is his other name&mdash; I'd rather call him "Star."

It's very mean of Science

To go and interfere!

I slew a worm the other day&mdash; A "Savant" passing by

Murmured "Resurgam"&mdash;"Centipede"!

"Oh Lord&mdash;how frail are we"!

I pull a flower from the woods&mdash; A monster with a glass

Computes the stamens in a breath&mdash; And has her in a "class"!

Whereas I took the Butterfly

Aforetime in my hat&mdash;

He sits erect in "Cabinets"&mdash; The Clover bells forgot.

What once was "Heaven"

Is "Zenith" now&mdash;

Where I proposed to go

When Time's brief masquerade was done

Is mapped and charted too.

What if the poles should frisk about

And stand upon their heads!

I hope I'm ready for "the worst"&mdash; Whatever prank betides!

Perhaps the "Kingdom of Heaven's" changed&mdash; I hope the "Children" there Won't be "new fashioned" when I come&mdash; And laugh at me&mdash;and stare&mdash; I hope the Father in the skies

Will lift his little girl&mdash;

Old fashioned&mdash;naught&mdash;everything&mdash; Over the stile of "Pearl."

Emily Dickinson





"Faith" is a fine invention


"Faith" is a fine invention

When Gentlemen can see&mdash;

But Microscopes are prudent

In an Emergency.

Emily Dickinson






"Heaven" has different Signs&mdash;to me&mdash; Sometimes, I think that Noon

Is but a symbol of the Place&mdash; And when again, at Dawn,

A mighty look runs round the World

And settles in the Hills&mdash;

An Awe if it should be like that

Upon the Ignorance steals&mdash;

The Orchard, when the Sun is on&mdash; The Triumph of the Birds

When they together Victory make&mdash; Some Carnivals of Clouds&mdash;

The Rapture of a finished Day&mdash; Returning to the West&mdash;

All these&mdash;remind us of the place That Men call "paradise"&mdash; Itself be fairer&mdash;we suppose&mdash; But how Ourself, shall be

Adorned, for a Superior Grace&mdash; Not yet, our eyes can see&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





"Heaven"&mdash;is what I cannot reach!


"Heaven"&mdash;is what I cannot reach!

The Apple on the Tree&mdash;

Provided it do hopeless&mdash;hang&mdash; That&mdash;"Heaven" is&mdash;to Me!

The Color, on the Cruising Cloud&mdash; The interdicted Land&mdash;

Behind the Hill&mdash;the House behind&mdash; There&mdash;Paradise&mdash;is found!

Her teasing Purples&mdash;Afternoons&mdash; The credulous&mdash;decoy&mdash; Enamored&mdash;of the Conjuror&mdash; That spurned us&mdash;Yesterday!

Emily Dickinson






"Hope" is the thing with feathers&mdash; That perches in the soul&mdash;

And sings the tune without the words&mdash; And never stops&mdash;at all&mdash; And sweetest&mdash;in the Gale&mdash;is heard&mdash; And sore must be the storm&mdash;

That could abash the little Bird

That kept so many warm&mdash;

I've heard it in the chillest land&mdash; And on the strangest Sea&mdash;

Yet, never, in Extremity,

It asked a crumb&mdash;of Me.

Emily Dickinson






"Houses"&mdash;so the Wise Men tell me&mdash;

"Mansions"! Mansions must be warm!

Mansions cannot let the tears in,

Mansions must exclude the storm!

"Many Mansions," by "his Father,"

I don't know him; snugly built!

Could the Children find the way there&mdash; Some, would even trudge tonight!

Emily Dickinson






"I want"&mdash;it pleaded&mdash;All its life&mdash; I want&mdash;was chief it said

When Skill entreated it&mdash;the last&mdash; And when so newly dead&mdash;

I could not deem it late&mdash;to hear That single&mdash;steadfast sigh&mdash; The lips had placed as with a "Please"

Toward Eternity&mdash;

Emily Dickinson






"Morning"&mdash;means "Milking"&mdash;to the Farmer&mdash; Dawn&mdash;to the Teneriffe&mdash; Dice&mdash;to the Maid&mdash;

Morning means just Risk&mdash;to the Lover&mdash; Just revelation&mdash;to the Beloved&mdash; Epicures&mdash;date a Breakfast&mdash;by it&mdash; Brides&mdash;an Apocalypse&mdash; Worlds&mdash;a Flood&mdash;

"Nature" is what we see


"Nature" is what we see&mdash; The Hill&mdash;the Afternoon&mdash; Squirrel&mdash;Eclipse&mdash;the Bumble bee&mdash; Nay&mdash;Nature is Heaven&mdash; Nature is what we hear&mdash;

So impotent Our Wisdom is

To her Simplicity.

"They have not chosen me," he said,

"But I have chosen them!"

Brave&mdash;Broken hearted statement&mdash; Uttered in Bethlehem!

I could not have told it,

But since Jesus dared&mdash;

Sovereign! Know a Daisy

Emily Dickinson






"Unto Me?" I do not know you&mdash; Where may be your House?

"Why do I love" You, Sir?


"Why do I love" You, Sir?

Because&mdash;

The Wind does not require the Grass

To answer&mdash;Wherefore when He pass She cannot keep Her place.

Because He knows&mdash;and

Do not You&mdash;

And We know not&mdash;

Enough for Us

The Wisdom it be so&mdash;

The Lightning&mdash;never asked an Eye Wherefore it shut&mdash;when He was by&mdash; Because He knows it cannot speak&mdash; And reasons not contained&mdash;

&mdash;Of Talk&mdash;

There be&mdash;preferred by Daintier Folk&mdash; The Sunrise&mdash;Sire&mdash;compelleth Me&mdash; Because He's Sunrise&mdash;and I see&mdash; Therefore&mdash;Then&mdash;

I love Thee&mdash;

A Bird Came Down

A bird came down the walk:

He did not know I saw;

He bit an angle-worm in halves

And ate the fellow, raw.

And then he drank a dew

From a convenient grass,

And then hopped sidewise to the wall

To let a beetle pass.

He glanced with rapid eyes

That hurried all abroad,--

They looked like frightened beads, I thought; He stirred his velvet head

Like one in danger; cautious,

I offered him a crumb,

And he unrolled his feathers

And rowed him softer home

Than oars divide the ocean,

Too silver for a seam,

Or butterflies, off banks of noon,

Leap, splashless, as they swim.

Emily Dickinson

A Book

There is no frigate like a book

To take us lands away,

Nor any coursers like a page

Of prancing poetry.

This traverse may the poorest take

Without oppress of toll;

How frugal is the chariot

That bears a human soul!

Emily Dickinson

Look further on!

A Clock stopped


A Clock stopped&mdash;

Not the Mantel's&mdash;

Geneva's farthest skill

Can't put the puppet bowing&mdash; That just now dangled still&mdash; An awe came on the Trinket!

The Figures hunched, with pain&mdash; Then quivered out of Decimals&mdash; Into Degreeless Noon&mdash;

It will not stir for Doctors&mdash; This Pendulum of snow&mdash;

This Shopman importunes it&mdash;

While cool&mdash;concernless No&mdash; Nods from the Gilded pointers&mdash; Nods from the Seconds slim&mdash;

Decades of Arrogance between

A Clock Stopped -- Not The Mantel's

A clock stopped -- not the mantel's

Geneva's farthest skill

Can't put the puppet bowing

That just now dangled still.

An awe came on the trinket!

The figures hunched with pain,

Then quivered out of decimals

Into degreeless noon.

It will not stir for doctors,

This pendulum of snow;

The shopman importunes it,

While cool, concernless No

Nods from the gilded pointers,

Nods from seconds slim,

Decades of arrogance between

The dial life and him.

A Cloud withdrew from the Sky


A Cloud withdrew from the Sky

Superior Glory be

But that Cloud and its Auxiliaries

Are forever lost to me

Had I but further scanned

Had I secured the Glow

In an Hermetic Memory

It had availed me now.

Never to pass the Angel

With a glance and a Bow

Till I am firm in Heaven

Is my intention now.

Emily Dickinson





A Coffin&mdash;is a small Domain


A Coffin&mdash;is a small Domain,

And Lands He looks upon

To Him who on its small Repose

Bestows a single Friend&mdash;

Circumference without Relief&mdash; Or Estimate&mdash;or End&mdash; Emily Dickinson

A darting fear&mdash;a pomp&mdash;a tear&mdash; A waking on a morn

To find that what one waked for,

Inhales the different dawn.

A Day! Help! Help! Another Day!


A Day! Help! Help! Another Day!

Your prayers, oh Passer by!

From such a common ball as this

Might date a Victory!

From marshallings as simple

The flags of nations swang.

Steady&mdash;my soul: What issues

Upon thine arrow hang!

A Death blow is a Life blow to Some


A Death blow is a Life blow to Some

A door just opened on a street

A door just opened on a street--

I, lost, was passing by--

An instant's width of warmth disclosed And wealth, and company.

The door as sudden shut, and I,

I, lost, was passing by,--

Lost doubly, but by contrast most,

Enlightening misery.

Emily Dickinson





A doubt if it be Us


A doubt if it be Us

Assists the staggering Mind

In an extremer Anguish

Until it footing find.

An Unreality is lent,

A merciful Mirage

That makes the living possible

While it suspends the lives.

Emily Dickinson





A drop fell on the apple tree

A drop fell on the apple tree

Another on the roof;

A half a dozen kissed the eaves,

And made the gables laugh.

A few went out to help the brook,

That went to help the sea.

Myself conjectured, Were they pearls,

What necklaces could be!

The dust replaced in hoisted roa

The birds jocoser sung;

The sunshine threw his hat away,

The orchards spangles hung.

The breezes brought dejected

And bathed them in the glee;

The East put out a single flag,

And signed the fete away.

Emily Dickinson






A Dying Tiger&mdash;moaned for Drink&mdash; I hunted all the Sand&mdash;

His Mighty Balls&mdash;in death were thick&mdash; But searching&mdash;I could see

A Vision on the Retina

Of Water&mdash;and of me&mdash;

But 'twas&mdash;the fact that He was dead&mdash; Emily Dickinson

A feather from the Whippoorwill


A feather from the Whippoorwill

That everlasting&mdash;sings!

Whose galleries&mdash;are Sunrise&mdash; Whose Opera&mdash;the Springs&mdash; Whose Emerald Nest the Ages spin

In "Recess"&mdash;Overhead!

Faith&mdash;alone&mdash;

A fuzzy fellow, without feet


A fuzzy fellow, without feet,

Yet doth exceeding run!

Of velvet, is his Countenance,

And his Complexion, dun!

Sometime, he dwelleth in the grass!

Sometime, upon a bough,

From which he doth descend in plush

Upon the Passer-by!

All this in summer.

But when winds alarm the Forest Folk,

He taketh Damask Residence&mdash;

And struts in sewing silk!

Then, finer than a Lady,

Emerges in the spring!

A Feather on each shoulder!

You'd scarce recognize him!

By Men, yclept Caterpillar!

By me! But who am I,

To tell the pretty secret

Of the Butterfly!

Emily Dickinson

A Lady red&mdash;amid the Hill


A Lady red&mdash;amid the Hill

Her annual secret keeps!

A Lady white, within the Field

In placid Lily sleeps!

The tidy Breezes, with their Brooms&mdash; Sweep vale&mdash;and hill&mdash;and tree!

Prithee, My pretty Housewives!

Who may expected be?

The Neighbors do not yet suspect!

The Woods exchange a smile!

Orchard, and Buttercup, and Bird&mdash; In such a little while!

And yet, how still the Landscape stands!

How nonchalant the Hedge!

As if the "Resurrection"

Were nothing very strange!

A light exists in spring

A light exists in spring

Not present on the year

At any other period.

When March is scarcely here

A color stands abroad

On solitary hills

That science cannot overtake,

But human naturefeels.

It waits upon the lawn;

It shows the furthest tree

Upon the furthest slope we know;

It almost speaks to me.

Then, as horizons step,

Or noons report away,

Without the formula of sound,

It passes, and we stay:

A quality of loss

Affecting our content,

As trade had suddenly encroached

Upon a sacrament.

Emily Dickinson






A little bread&mdash;a crust&mdash;a crumb&mdash; A little trust&mdash;a demijohn&mdash; Can keep the soul alive&mdash;

Not portly, mind! but breathing&mdash;warm&mdash; Conscious&mdash;as old Napoleon,

A modest lot&mdash;A fame petite&mdash; A brief Campaign of sting and sweet

Is plenty! Is enough!

A Sailor's business is the shore!

A Soldier's&mdash;balls! Who asketh more, Must seek the neighboring life!

A little East of Jordan


A little East of Jordan,

Evangelists record,

A Gymnast and an Angel

Did wrestle long and hard&mdash;

Till morning touching mountain&mdash; And Jacob, waxing strong,

The Angel begged permission

To Breakfast&mdash;to return&mdash; Not so, said cunning Jacob!

"I will not let thee go

Except thou bless me"&mdash;Stranger!

The which acceded to&mdash;

Light swung the silver fleeces

"Peniel" Hills beyond,

And the bewildered Gymnast

Found he had worsted God!

A little road not made man

Bears me along that way.

To bask the centuries away

Nor once look up for noon?

A loss of something ever felt I


A loss of something ever felt I&mdash; The first that I could recollect

Bereft I was&mdash;of what I knew not Too young that any should suspect

A Mourner walked among the children

I notwithstanding went about

As one bemoaning a Dominion

Itself the only Prince cast out&mdash; Elder, Today, a session wiser

And fainter, too, as Wiseness is&mdash; I find myself still softly searching

For my Delinguent Palaces&mdash;

And a Suspicion, like a Finger

Touches my Forehead now and then

That I am looking oppositely

For the site of the Kingdom of Heaven&mdash; Emily Dickinson

A Mien to move a Queen


A Mien to move a Queen&mdash;

Half Child&mdash;Half Heroine&mdash; An Orleans in the Eye

For humbler Company

When none are near

Even a Tear&mdash;

Its frequent Visitor&mdash;

A Bonnet like a Duke&mdash;

And yet a Wren's Peruke

Were not so shy

Of Goer by&mdash;

And Hands&mdash;so slight&mdash; They would elate a Sprite

With Merriment&mdash;

A Voice that Alters&mdash;Low

And on the Ear can go

Like Let of Snow&mdash;

Or shift supreme&mdash;

As tone of Realm

On Subjects Diadem&mdash;

Too small&mdash;to fear&mdash; Too distant&mdash;to endear&mdash; And so Men Compromise

And just&mdash;revere&mdash;

A narrow fellow in the grass

A narrow fellow in the grass

Occasionally rides;

You may have met him,--did you not,

His notice sudden is.

The grass divides as with a comb,

A spotted shaft is seen;

And then it closes at your feet

And opens further on.

He likes a boggy acre,

A floor too cool for corn.

Yet when a child, and barefoot,

I more than once, at morn,

Have passed, I thought, a whip-lash

Unbraiding in the sun,--

When, stooping to secure it,

It wrinkled, and was gone.

Several of nature's people

I know, and they know me;

I feel for them a transport

Of cordiality;

But never met this fellow,

Attended or alone,

Without a tighter breathing,

And zero at the bone.

Emily Dickinson





A nearness to Tremendousness


A nearness to Tremendousness&mdash; An Agony procures&mdash;

Affliction ranges Boundlessness&mdash; Vicinity to Laws

Contentment's quiet Suburb&mdash;

A Night—there lay the Days between—

The Day that was Before—

Till it be night—no more—

A poor&mdash;torn heart&mdash;a tattered heart&mdash; That sat it down to rest&mdash;

Nor noticed that the Ebbing Day

Flowed silver to the West&mdash;

Nor noticed Night did soft descend&mdash; Nor Constellation burn&mdash;

Intent upon the vision

Of latitudes unknown.

The angels&mdash;happening that way This dusty heart espied&mdash;

Tenderly took it up from toil

And carried it to God&mdash;

There&mdash;sandals for the Barefoot&mdash; There&mdash;gathered from the gales&mdash; Do the blue havens by the hand

Lead the wandering Sails.

A precious—mouldering pleasure


A precious—mouldering pleasure—'tis—

To meet an Antique Book—

In just the Dress his Century wore—

A privilege—I think—

His venerable Hand to take—

And warming in our own—

A passage back—or two—to make—

To Times when he—was young—

His quaint opinions—to inspect—

His thought to ascertain

On Themes concern our mutual mind—

The Literature of Man—

What interested Scholars—most—

What Competitions ran—

When Plato—was a Certainty—

And Sophocles—a Man—

When Sappho—was a living Girl—

And Beatrice wore

The Gown that Dante—deified—

Facts Centuries before

He traverses—familiar—

As One should come to Town—

And tell you all your Dreams—were true—

He lived—where Dreams were born—

His presence is Enchantment—

You beg him not to go—

Old Volume shake their Vellum Heads

And tantalize—just so—

A Prison gets to be a friend


A Prison gets to be a friend&mdash; Between its Ponderous face

And Ours&mdash;a Kinsmanship express&mdash; And in its narrow Eyes&mdash;

We come to look with gratitude

For the appointed Beam

It deal us&mdash;stated as our food&mdash; And hungered for&mdash;the same&mdash; We learn to know the Planks&mdash; That answer to Our feet&mdash;

So miserable a sound&mdash;at first&mdash; Nor ever now&mdash;so sweet&mdash; As plashing in the Pools&mdash;

When Memory was a Boy&mdash;

But a Demurer Circuit&mdash;

A Geometric Joy&mdash;

The Posture of the Key

That interrupt the Day

To Our Endeavor&mdash;Not so real

The Check of Liberty&mdash;

As this Phantasm Steel&mdash;

Whose features&mdash;Day and Night&mdash; Are present to us&mdash;as Our Own&mdash; And as escapeless&mdash;quite&mdash; The narrow Round&mdash;the Stint&mdash; The slow exchange of Hope&mdash;

For something passiver&mdash;Content Too steep for lookinp up&mdash;

The Liberty we knew

Avoided&mdash;like a Dream&mdash; Too wide for any Night but Heaven&mdash; If That&mdash;indeed&mdash;redeem&mdash; Emily Dickinson





A Route of Evanescence

A Route of Evanescence

With a revolving Wheel--

A Resonance of Emerald--

A Rush of Cochineal--

And every Blossom on the Bush

Adjusts its tumbled Head--

The mail from Tunis, probably,

An easy Morning's Ride--

Emily Dickinson






A science&mdash;so the Savants say,

"Comparative Anatomy"&mdash; By which a single bone&mdash;

Is made a secret to unfold

Of some rare tenant of the mold,

Else perished in the stone&mdash;

So to the eye prospective led,

This meekest flower of the mead

Upon a winter's day,

Stands representative in gold

Of Rose and Lily, manifold,

And countless Butterfly!

A sepal, petal, and a thorn


A sepal, petal, and a thorn

Upon a common summer's morn&mdash; A flask of Dew&mdash;A Bee or two&mdash; A Breeze&mdash;a caper in the trees&mdash; And I'm a Rose!

A Shade upon the mind there passes


A Shade upon the mind there passes

As when on Noon

A Cloud the mighty Sun encloses

Remembering

That some there be too numb to notice

Oh God

Why give if Thou must take away

The Loved?

Emily Dickinson





A shady friend for torrid days

A shady friend for torrid days

Is easier to find

Than one of higher temperature

For frigid hour of mind.

The vane a little to the east

Scares muslin souls away;

If broadcloth breasts are firmer

Than those of organdy,

Who is to blame? The weaver?

Ah! the bewildering thread!

The tapestries of paradise!

So notelessly are made!

A single Screw of Flesh


Is all that pins the Soul

That stands for Deity, to Mine,

Upon my side the Veil&mdash;

Once witnessed of the Gauze&mdash; Its name is put away

As far from mine, as if no plight

Had printed yesterday,

In tender&mdash;solemn Alphabet,

My eyes just turned to see,

When it was smuggled by my sight

Into Eternity&mdash;

More Hands&mdash;to hold&mdash;These are but Two&mdash; One more new-mailed Nerve

Just granted, for the Peril's sake&mdash; Some striding&mdash;Giant&mdash;Love&mdash; So greater than the Gods can show,

They slink before the Clay,

That not for all their Heaven can boast Will let its Keepsake&mdash;go

A slash of Blue


A slash of Blue&mdash;

A sweep of Gray&mdash;

Some scarlet patches on the way,

Compose an Evening Sky&mdash;

A little purple&mdash;slipped between&mdash; Some Ruby Trousers hurried on&mdash; A Wave of Gold&mdash;

A Bank of Day&mdash;

This just makes out the Morning Sky.

Emily Dickinson





A Solemn thing within the Soul


A Solemn thing within the Soul

To feel itself get ripe&mdash;

And golden hang&mdash;while farther up&mdash; The Maker's Ladders stop&mdash;

And in the Orchard far below&mdash; You hear a Being&mdash;drop&mdash; A Wonderful&mdash;to feel the Sun

Still toiling at the Cheek

You thought was finished&mdash;

Cool of eye, and critical of Work&mdash; He shifts the stem&mdash;a little&mdash; To give your Core&mdash;a look&mdash; But solemnest&mdash;to know

Your chance in Harvest moves

A little nearer&mdash;Every Sun

The Single&mdash;to some lives.

Emily Dickinson






A solemn thing&mdash;it was&mdash;I said&mdash; A woman&mdash;white&mdash;to be&mdash; And wear&mdash;if God should count me fit&mdash; Her blameless mystery&mdash;

A hallowed thing&mdash;to drop a life Into the purple well&mdash;

Too plummetless&mdash;that it return&mdash; Eternity&mdash;until&mdash;

I pondered how the bliss would look&mdash; And would it feel as big&mdash;

When I could take it in my hand&mdash; As hovering&mdash;seen&mdash;through fog&mdash; And then&mdash;the size of this "small" life&mdash; The Sages&mdash;call it small&mdash; Swelled&mdash;like Horizons&mdash;in my vest&mdash; And I sneered&mdash;softly&mdash;"small"!

Emily Dickinson





A solemn thing—it was—I said


A solemn thing—it was—I said—

Into the purple well—

Too plummetless—that it return—

Eternity—until—

I pondered how the bliss would look—

And would it feel as big—

When I could take it in my hand—

Swelled—like Horizons—in my vest—

A something in a summer's Day


A something in a summer's Day

As slow her flambeaux burn away

Which solemnizes me.

A something in a summer's noon&mdash; A depth&mdash;an Azure&mdash;a perfume&mdash; Transcending ecstasy.

And still within a summer's night

A something so transporting bright

I clap my hands to see&mdash;

Then veil my too inspecting face

Lets such a subtle&mdash;shimmering grace Flutter too far for me&mdash;

The wizard fingers never rest&mdash; The purple brook within the breast

Still chafes it narrow bed&mdash;

Still rears the East her amber Flag&mdash; Guides still the sun along the Crag

His Caravan of Red&mdash;

So looking on&mdash;the night&mdash;the morn Conclude the wonder gay&mdash;

And I meet, coming thro' the dews

Another summer's Day!

Emily Dickinson





A South Wind&mdash;has a pathos


A South Wind&mdash;has a pathos

Of individual Voice&mdash;

As One detect on Landings

An Emigrant's address.

A Hint of Ports and Peoples&mdash; And much not understood&mdash;

The fairer&mdash;for the farness&mdash; And for the foreignhood.

A Thought went up my mind today


A Thought went up my mind today&mdash; That I have had before&mdash;

But did not finish&mdash;some way back&mdash; I could not fix the Year&mdash;

Nor where it went&mdash;nor why it came The second time to me&mdash;

A thought went up my mind to-day

A thought went up my mind to-day

That I have had before,

But did not finish,--some way back,

I could not fix the year,

Nor where it went, nor why it came

The second time to me,

Nor definitely what it was,

Have I the art to say.

But somewhere in my soul, I know

I've met the thing before;

It just reminded me--'t was all--

And came my way no more.

Emily Dickinson





A throe upon the features


A throe upon the features&mdash;

A hurry in the breath&mdash;

An ecstasy of parting

Denominated "Death"&mdash; An anguish at the mention

Which when to patience grown,

I've known permission given

To rejoin its own.

Emily Dickinson





A toad can die of light!

A toad can die of light!

Death is the common right

Of toads and men,--

Of earl and midge

The privilege.

Why swagger then?

The gnat's supremacy

Is large as thine.

The Universe would go!

A Wounded Deer&mdash;leaps highest&mdash; I've heard the Hunter tell&mdash;

'Tis but the Ecstasy of death&mdash; And then the Brake is still!

The Smitten Rock that gushes!

The trampled Steel that springs!

A Cheek is always redder

Just where the Hectic stings!

Mirth is the Mail of Anguish

In which it Cautious Arm,

Lest anybody spy the blood

And "you're hurt" exclaim!

Abraham to Kill Him

Abraham to kill him

Was distinctly told—

Isaac was an Urchin—

Abraham was old—

Not a hesitation—

Abraham complied—

Flattered by Obeisance

Tyranny demurred—

Isaac—to his children

Lived to tell the tale—

Moral—with a mastiff

Manners may prevail.

Adrift! A little boat adrift!


Adrift! A little boat adrift!

And night is coming down!

Will no one guide a little boat

Unto the nearest town?

So Sailors say&mdash;on yesterday&mdash; Just as the dusk was brown

One little boat gave up its strife

And gurgled down and down.

So angels say&mdash;on yesterday&mdash; Just as the dawn was red

One little boat&mdash;o'erspent with gales&mdash; Retrimmed its masts&mdash;redecked its sails&mdash; And shot&mdash;exultant on!

Emily Dickinson





Afraid! Of whom am I afraid?


Afraid! Of whom am I afraid?

Not Death&mdash;for who is He?

The Porter of my Father's Lodge

As much abasheth me!

Of Life? 'Twere odd I fear [a] thing

That comprehendeth me

In one or two existences&mdash;

As Deity decree&mdash;

Of Resurrection? Is the East

Afraid to trust the Morn

With her fastidious forehead?

As soon impeach my Crown!

Emily Dickinson





After a hundred years

After a hundred years

Nobody knows the place,--

Agony, that enacted there,

Motionless as peace.

Weeds triumphant ranged,

Strangers strolled and spelled

At the lone orthography

Of the elder dead.

Winds of summer fields

Recollect the way,--

Instinct picking up the key

Dropped by memory.

Emily Dickinson





After Great Pain, A Formal Feeling Comes After great pain, a formal feeling comes--

The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Toombs--

The stiff Heart questions was it He, that bore, And Yesterday, or Centuries before?

The Feet, mechanical, go round--

Of Ground, or Air, or Ought--

A Wooden way

Regardless grown,

A Quartz contentment, like a stone--

This is the Hour of Lead--

Remembered, if outlived,

As Freezing persons recollect the Snow--

First--Chill--then Stupor--then the letting go--

For such an one&mdash;as me&mdash; I take a flower&mdash;as I go&mdash; My face to justify&mdash;

All overgrown by cunning moss


All overgrown by cunning moss,

All interspersed with weed,

The little cage of "Currer Bell"

In quiet "Haworth" laid.

Gathered from many wanderings&mdash; Gethsemane can tell

She reached the Asphodel!

Soft falls the sounds of Eden

Upon her puzzled ear&mdash;

Oh what an afternoon for Heaven,

When "Bronte" entered there!

To him who keeps an Orchis' heart&mdash; The swamps are pink with June.

Emily Dickinson





Alone, I cannot be


Alone, I cannot be&mdash;

For Hosts&mdash;do visit me&mdash; Recordless Company&mdash;

Who baffle Key&mdash;

They have no Robes, nor Names&mdash; No Almanacs&mdash;nor Climes&mdash; But general Homes

Like Gnomes&mdash;

Their Coming, may be known

By Couriers within&mdash;

Their going&mdash;is not&mdash; For they've never gone&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Alter! When the Hills do


Alter! When the Hills do&mdash;

Falter! When the Sun

Question if His Glory

Be the Perfect One&mdash;

Surfeit! When the Daffodil

Doth of the Dew&mdash;

Even as Herself&mdash;Sir&mdash; I will&mdash;of You&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Although I put away his life


Although I put away his life&mdash; An Ornament too grand

For Forehead low as mine, to wear,

This might have been the Hand

That sowed the flower, he preferred&mdash; Or smoothed a homely pain,

Or pushed the pebble from his path&mdash; Or played his chosen tune&mdash;

On Lute the least&mdash;the latest&mdash; But just his Ear could know

That whatsoe'er delighted it,

I never would let go&mdash;

The foot to bear his errand&mdash; A little Boot I know&mdash;

Would leap abroad like Antelope&mdash; With just the grant to do&mdash;

His weariest Commandment&mdash;

A sweeter to obey,

Than "Hide and Seek"&mdash; Or skip to Flutes&mdash;

Or all Day, chase the Bee&mdash;

Your Servant, Sir, will weary&mdash; The Surgeon, will not come&mdash;

The World, will have its own&mdash;to do&mdash; The Dust, will vex your Fame&mdash; The Cold will force your tightest door Some February Day,

But say my apron bring the sticks

To make your Cottage gay&mdash;

That I may take that promise

To Paradise, with me&mdash;

To teach the Angels, avarice,

You, Sir, taught first&mdash;to me.

Emily Dickinson





Always Mine!


Always Mine!

No more Vacation!

Term of Light this Day begun!

Failless as the fair rotation

Of the Seasons and the Sun.

Old the Grace, but new the Subjects&mdash; Old, indeed, the East,

Yet upon His Purple Programme

Every Dawn, is first.

Emily Dickinson





Ambition cannot find him


Ambition cannot find him.

Affection doesn't know

How many leagues of nowhere

Lie between them now.

Yesterday, undistinguished!

Eminent Today

For our mutual hone, Immortality!

Emily Dickinson





Ample make this Bed


Ample make this Bed&mdash;

Make this Bed with Awe&mdash;

In it wait till Judgment break

Excellent and Fair.

Be its Mattress straight&mdash;

Be its Pillow round&mdash;

Let no Sunrise' yellow noise

Interrupt this Ground&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Ample make this bed.

Ample make this bed.

Make this bed with awe;

In it wait till judgment break

Excellent and fair.

Be its mattress straight,

Be its pillow round;

Let no sunrise' yellow noise

Interrupt this ground.

Emily Dickinson





An altered look about the hills


An altered look about the hills&mdash; A Tyrian light the village fills&mdash; A wider sunrise in the morn&mdash; A deeper twilight on the lawn&mdash; A print of a vermillion foot&mdash; A purple finger on the slope&mdash; A flippant fly upon the pane&mdash; A spider at his trade again&mdash; An added strut in Chanticleer&mdash; A flower expected everywhere&mdash; An axe shrill singing in the woods&mdash; Fern odors on untravelled roads&mdash; All this and more I cannot tell&mdash; A furtive look you know as well&mdash; And Nicodemus' Mystery

Receives its annual reply!

Emily Dickinson





An awful Tempest mashed the air


An awful Tempest mashed the air&mdash; The clouds were gaunt, and few&mdash; A Black&mdash;as of a Spectre's Cloak Hid Heaven and Earth from view.

The creatures chuckled on the Roofs&mdash; And whistled in the air&mdash;

And shook their fists&mdash;

And gnashed their teeth&mdash;

And swung their frenzied hair.

The morning lit&mdash;the Birds arose&mdash; The Monster's faded eyes

Turned slowly to his native coast&mdash; And peace&mdash;was Paradise!

Emily Dickinson





An English Breeze

UP with the sun, the breeze arose,

Across the talking corn she goes,

And smooth she rustles far and wide

Through all the voiceful countryside.

Through all the land her tale she tells; She spins, she tosses, she compels

The kites, the clouds, the windmill sails And all the trees in all the dales.

God calls us, and the day prepares

With nimble, gay and gracious airs:

And from Penzance to Maidenhead

The roads last night He watered.

God calls us from inglorious ease,

Forth and to travel with the breeze

While, swift and singing, smooth and strong She gallops by the fields along.

Emily Dickinson





An everywhere of silver

An everywhere of silver,

With ropes of sand

To keep it from effacing

The track called land.

With ropes of sand

The track called land.

An Hour is a Sea


An Hour is a Sea

Between a few, and me&mdash;

With them would Harbor be&mdash;

An ignorance a Sunset


An ignorance a Sunset

Confer upon the Eye&mdash;

Of Territory&mdash;Color&mdash; Circumference&mdash;Decay&mdash; Its Amber Revelation

Exhilirate&mdash;Debase&mdash; Omnipotence' inspection

Of Our inferior face&mdash;

And when the solemn features

Confirm&mdash;in Victory&mdash; We start&mdash;as if detected

In Immortality&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





And this of all my Hopes


And this of all my Hopes

This, is the silent end

Bountiful colored, my Morning rose

Early and sere, its end

Never Bud from a Stem

Stepped with so gay a Foot

Never a Worm so confident

Bored at so brave a Root

Emily Dickinson





Angels, in the early morning


Angels, in the early morning

May be seen the Dews among,

Stooping&mdash;plucking&mdash;smiling&mdash;flying&mdash; Do the Buds to them belong?

Angels, when the sun is hottest

May be seen the sands among,

Stooping&mdash;plucking&mdash;sighing&mdash;flying&mdash; Parched the flowers they bear along.

Emily Dickinson





Answer July

Where is the Bee&mdash;

Ah, said July&mdash;

Where is the Seed&mdash;

Nay&mdash;said the May&mdash;

Show me the Snow&mdash;

Apology for Her


Apology for Her

Be rendered by the Bee&mdash;

Herself, without a Parliament

Apology for Me.

Emily Dickinson





Apparently with no Surprise

Apparently with no surprise,

To any happy flower,

The frost beheads it at its play,

In accidental power.

The blond assassin passes on.

The sun proceeds unmoved,

To measure off another day,

For an approving God.

Emily Dickinson





Arcturus

"Arcturus" is his other name—

I'd rather call him "Star."

It's very mean of Science

To go and interfere!

I slew a worm the other day—

A "Savant" passing by

Murmured "Resurgam"—"Centipede"!

"Oh Lord—how frail are we"!

I pull a flower from the woods—

A monster with a glass

Computes the stamens in a breath—

And has her in a "class"!

Whereas I took the Butterfly

Aforetime in my hat—

He sits erect in "Cabinets"—

The Clover bells forgot.

What once was "Heaven"

Is "Zenith" now—

Where I proposed to go

When Time's brief masquerade was done

Is mapped and charted too.

What if the poles should frisk about

And stand upon their heads!

I hope I'm ready for "the worst"—

Whatever prank betides!

Perhaps the "Kingdom of Heaven's" changed—

I hope the "Children" there Won't be "new fashioned" when I come—

And laugh at me—and stare—

I hope the Father in the skies

Will lift his little girl—

Old fashioned—naught—everything—

Over the stile of "Pearl."

Emily Dickinson





Artists wrestled here!


Artists wrestled here!

Lo, a tint Cashmere!

Lo, a Rose!

Student of the Year!

For the easel here

Say Repose!

Emily Dickinson





As by the dead we love to sit


As by the dead we love to sit,

Become so wondrous dear&mdash;

As for the lost we grapple

Tho' all the rest are here&mdash;

In broken mathematics

We estimate our prize

Vast&mdash;in its fading ration

To our penurious eyes!

Emily Dickinson





As Children bid the Guest


As Children bid the Guest "Good Night"

And then reluctant turn—

My flowers raise their pretty lips—

Then put their nightgowns on.

As children caper when they wake

Merry that it is Morn—

My flowers from a hundred cribs

Will peep, and prance again.

Emily Dickinson

With Ropes of Sand

Emily Dickinson





As far from pity, as complaint


As far from pity, as complaint&mdash; As cool to speech&mdash;as stone&mdash; As numb to Revelation

As if my Trade were Bone&mdash;

As far from time&mdash;as History&mdash; As near yourself&mdash;Today&mdash; As Children, to the Rainbow's scarf&mdash; Or Sunset's Yellow play

To eyelids in the Sepulchre&mdash; How dumb the Dancer lies&mdash;

While Color's Revelations break&mdash; And blaze&mdash;the Butterflies!

Emily Dickinson





As Frost is best conceived


As Frost is best conceived

By force of its Result&mdash;

Affliction is inferred

By subsequent effect&mdash;

If when the sun reveal,

The Garden keep the Gash&mdash;

If as the Days resume

The wilted countenance

Cannot correct the crease

Or counteract the stain&mdash;

Presumption is Vitality

Was somewhere put in twain.

Emily Dickinson





As if I asked a common Alms


As if I asked a common Alms,

And in my wondering hand

A Stranger pressed a Kingdom,

And I, bewildered, stand&mdash;

As if I asked the Orient

Had it for me a Morn&mdash;

And it should lift its purple Dikes,

And shatter me with Dawn!

Emily Dickinson





As if some little Arctic flower


As if some little Arctic flower

Upon the polar hem&mdash;

Went wandering down the Latitudes

Until it puzzled came

To continents of summer&mdash;

To firmaments of sun&mdash;

To strange, bright crowds of flowers&mdash; And birds, of foreign tongue!

I say, As if this little flower

To Eden, wandered in&mdash;

What then? Why nothing,

Only, your inference therefrom!

Emily Dickinson





As if the Sea should part


As if the Sea should part

And show a further Sea&mdash;

And that&mdash;a further&mdash;and the Three But a presumption be&mdash;

Of Periods of Seas&mdash;

Unvisited of Shores&mdash;

Themselves the Verge of Seas to be&mdash; Eternity&mdash;is Those&mdash; Emily Dickinson





As imperceptibly as Grief


As imperceptibly as Grief

The Summer lapsed away&mdash;

Too imperceptible at last

To seem like Perfidy&mdash;

A Quietness distilled

As Twilight long begun,

Or Nature spending with herself

Sequestered Afternoon&mdash;

The Dusk drew earlier in&mdash;

The Morning foreign shone&mdash;

A courteous, yet harrowing Grace,

As Guest, that would be gone&mdash; And thus, without a Wing

Or service of a Keel

Our Summer made her light escape

Into the Beautiful.

Emily Dickinson





As One does Sickness over


As One does Sickness over

In convalescent Mind,

His scrutiny of Chances

By blessed Health obscured&mdash;

As One rewalks a Precipice

And whittles at the Twig

That held Him from Perdition

Sown sidewise in the Crag

A Custom of the Soul

Far after suffering

Identity to question

For evidence't has been&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





As plan for Noon and plan for Night


As plan for Noon and plan for Night

So differ Life and Death

In positive Prospective&mdash;

The Foot upon the Earth

At Distance, and Achievement, strains, The Foot upon the Grave

Makes effort at conclusion

Assisted faint of Love.

Emily Dickinson





As Sleigh Bells seem in summer


As Sleigh Bells seem in summer

Or Bees, at Christmas show&mdash;

So fairy&mdash;so fictitious

The individuals do

Repealed from observation&mdash;

A Party that we knew&mdash;

More distant in an instant

Than Dawn in Timbuctoo.

Emily Dickinson






As the Starved Maelstrom laps the Navies As the Vulture teased

Forces the Broods in lonely Valleys

As the Tiger eased

By but a Crumb of Blood, fasts Scarlet Till he meet a Man

Dainty adorned with Veins and Tissues

And partakes&mdash;his Tongue

Cooled by the Morsel for a moment

Grows a fiercer thing

Till he esteem his Dates and Cocoa

A Nutrition mean

I, of a finer Famine

Deem my Supper dry

For but a Berry of Domingo

And a Torrid Eye.

Emily Dickinson





As Watchers hang upon the East


As Watchers hang upon the East,

As Beggars revel at a feast

By savory Fancy spread&mdash;

As brooks in deserts babble sweet

On ear too far for the delight,

Heaven beguiles the tired.

As that same watcher, when the East

Opens the lid of Amethyst

And lets the morning go&mdash;

That Beggar, when an honored Guest,

Those thirsty lips to flagons pressed, Heaven to us, if true.

Emily Dickinson





At last, to be identified!


At last, to be identified!

At last, the lamps upon thy side

The rest of Life to see!

Past Midnight! Past the Morning Star!

Past Sunrise!

Ah, What leagues there were

Between our feet, and Day!

At least&mdash;to pray&mdash;is left&mdash;is left&mdash; Oh Jesus&mdash;in the Air&mdash; I know not which thy chamber is&mdash; I'm knocking&mdash;everywhere&mdash; Thou settest Earthquake in the South&mdash; And Maelstrom, in the Sea&mdash;

At least—to pray—is left—is left

At leisure is the Soul


At leisure is the Soul

That gets a Staggering Blow&mdash; The Width of Life&mdash;before it spreads Without a thing to do&mdash;

It begs you give it Work&mdash;

But just the placing Pins&mdash;

Or humblest Patchwork&mdash;Children do&mdash; To Help its Vacant Hands&mdash;

Emily Dickinson

Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine, Unwind the solemn twine, and tie my Valentine!

Oh the Earth was made for lovers, for damsel, and hopeless swain, For sighing, and gentle whispering, and unity made of twain.

All things do go a courting, in earth, or sea, or air, God hath made nothing single but thee in His world so fair!

The bride, and then the bridegroom, the two, and then the one, Adam, and Eve, his consort, the moon, and then the sun; The life doth prove the precept, who obey shall happy be, Who will not serve the sovereign, be hanged on fatal tree.

The high do seek the lowly, the great do seek the small, None cannot find who seeketh, on this terrestrial ball; The bee doth court the flower, the flower his suit receives, And they make merry wedding, whose guests are hundred leaves; The wind doth woo the branches, the branches they are won, And the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son.

The storm doth walk the seashore humming a mournful tune, The wave with eye so pensive, looketh to see the moon, Their spirits meet together, they make their solemn vows, No more he singeth mournful, her sadness she doth lose.

The worm doth woo the mortal, death claims a living bride, Night unto day is married, morn unto eventide; Earth is a merry damsel, and heaven a knight so true, And Earth is quite coquettish, and beseemeth in vain to sue.

Now to the application, to the reading of the roll, To bringing thee to justice, and marshalling thy soul: Thou art a human solo, a being cold, and lone, Wilt have no kind companion, thou reap'st what thou hast sown.

Hast never silent hours, and minutes all too long, And a deal of sad reflection, and wailing instead of song?

There's Sarah, and Eliza, and Emeline so fair, And Harriet, and Susan, and she with curling hair!

Thine eyes are sadly blinded, but yet thou mayest see Six true, and comely maidens sitting upon the tree; Approach that tree with caution, then up it boldly climb, And seize the one thou lovest, nor care for space, or time!

Then bear her to the greenwood, and build for her a bower, And give her what she asketh, jewel, or bird, or flower&mdash; And bring the fife, and trumpet, and beat upon the drum&mdash; And bid the world Goodmorrow, and go to glory home!

Emily Dickinson





Away from Home are some and I—


Away from Home are some and I—

An Emigrant to be

In a Metropolis of Homes

Is easy, possibly—

The Habit of a Foreign Sky

We—difficult—acquire

As Children, who remain in Face

The more their Feet retire.

Emily Dickinson

Baffled for just a day or two


Baffled for just a day or two&mdash; Embarrassed&mdash;not afraid&mdash; Encounter in my garden

An unexpected Maid.

She beckons, and the woods start&mdash; She nods, and all begin&mdash;

Surely, such a country

I was never in!

Emily Dickinson





Banish Air from Air—


Banish Air from Air—

Divide Light if you dare—

They'll meet

While Cubes in a Drop

Or Pellets of Shape

Fit

Films cannot annul

Odors return whole

Force Flame

And with a Blonde push

Over your impotence

Flits Steam.

Because I could not stop for Death

Because I could not stop for Death,

He kindly stopped for me;

The carriage held but just ourselves

And Immortality.

We slowly drove, he knew no haste,

And I had put away

My labor, and my leisure too,

For his civility.

We passed the school where children played, Their lessons scarcely done;

We passed the fields of grazing grain, We passed the setting sun.

We paused before a house that seemed

A swelling of the ground;

The roof was scarcely visible,

The cornice but a mound.

Since then 't is centuries; but each

Feels shorter than the day

I first surmised the horses' heads

Were toward eternity.

We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain--

We passed the Setting Sun--

Or rather--He passed us--

The Dews drew quivering and chill--

For only Gossamer, my Gown--

My Tippet--only Tulle--

We paused before a House that seemed

A Swelling of the Ground--

The Roof was scarcely visible--

The Cornice--in the Ground--

Since then--'tis Centuries--and yet

Feels shorter than the Day

I first surmised the Horses' Heads

Were toward Eternity--

Because the Bee may blameless hum


Because the Bee may blameless hum

For Thee a Bee do I become

List even unto Me.

Because the Flowers unafraid

May lift a look on thine, a Maid

Alway a Flower would be.

Nor Robins, Robins need not hide

When Thou upon their Crypts intrude

So Wings bestow on Me

Or Petals, or a Dower of Buzz

That Bee to ride, or Flower of Furze

I that way worship Thee.

Emily Dickinson





Beclouded

The sky is low, the clouds are mean,

A travelling flake of snow

Across a barn or through a rut

Debates if it will go.

A narrow wind complains all day

How some one treated him;

Nature, like us, is sometimes caught

Without her diadem.

Emily Dickinson





Bee! I'm expecting you!


Bee! I'm expecting you!

Was saying Yesterday

To Somebody you know

That you were due&mdash;

The Frogs got Home last Week&mdash; Are settled, and at work&mdash;

Birds, mostly back&mdash;

The Clover warm and thick&mdash;

You'll get my Letter by

The seventeenth; Reply

Or better, be with me&mdash;

Yours, Fly.

Before I got my eye put out


Before I got my eye put out

I liked as well to see&mdash;

As other Creatures, that have Eyes

And know no other way&mdash;

But were it told to me&mdash;Today&mdash; That I might have the sky

For mine&mdash;I tell you that my Heart Would split, for size of me&mdash; The Meadows&mdash;mine&mdash;

The Mountains&mdash;mine&mdash; All Forests&mdash;Stintless Stars&mdash; As much of Noon as I could take

Between my finite eyes&mdash;

The Motions of the Dipping Birds&mdash; The Morning's Amber Road&mdash;

For mine&mdash;to look at when I liked&mdash; The News would strike me dead&mdash; So safer&mdash;guess&mdash;with just my soul Upon the Window pane&mdash;

Where other Creatures put their eyes&mdash; Incautious&mdash;of the Sun&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Before the ice is in the pools


Before the ice is in the pools&mdash; Before the skaters go,

Or any check at nightfall

Is tarnished by the snow&mdash;

Before the fields have finished,

Before the Christmas tree,

Wonder upon wonder

Will arrive to me!

What we touch the hems of

On a summer's day&mdash;

What is only walking

Just a bridge away&mdash;

That which sings so&mdash;speaks so&mdash; When there's no one here&mdash;

Will the frock I wept in

Answer me to wear?

Emily Dickinson





Before you thought of spring,

Before you thought of spring,

Except as a surmise,

You see, God bless his suddenness,

A fellow in the skies

Of independent hues,

A little weather-worn,

Inspiriting habiliments

Of indigo and brown.

With specimens of song,

As if for you to choose,

Discretion in the interval,

With gay delays he goes

To some superior tree

Without a single leaf,

And shouts for joy to nobody

But his seraphic self!

Emily Dickinson

Bereaved of all, I went abroad


Bereaved of all, I went abroad&mdash; No less bereaved was I

Upon a New Peninsula&mdash;

The Grave preceded me&mdash;

Obtained my Lodgings, ere myself&mdash; And when I sought my Bed&mdash;

The Grave it was reposed upon

The Pillow for my Head&mdash;

I waked to find it first awake&mdash; I rose&mdash;It followed me&mdash; I tried to drop it in the Crowd&mdash; To lose it in the Sea&mdash;

In Cups of artificial Drowse

To steep its shape away&mdash;

The Grave&mdash;was finished&mdash;but the Spade Remained in Memory&mdash;

Whom Death see first&mdash;'tis news of this That paralyze Ourselves&mdash;

Besides the Autumn poets sing


Besides the Autumn poets sing

A few prosaic days

A little this side of the snow

And that side of the Haze&mdash;

A few incisive Mornings&mdash;

A few Ascetic Eves&mdash;

Gone&mdash;Mr. Bryant's "Golden Rod"&mdash; And Mr. Thomson's "sheaves."

Still, is the bustle in the Brook&mdash; Sealed are the spicy valves&mdash; Mesmeric fingers softly touch

The Eyes of many Elves&mdash;

Perhaps a squirrel may remain&mdash; My sentiments to share&mdash;

Grant me, Oh Lord, a sunny mind&mdash; Thy windy will to bear!

Better&mdash;than Music! For I&mdash;who heard it&mdash; I was used&mdash;to the Birds&mdash;before&mdash; This&mdash;was different&mdash;'Twas Translation&mdash; Of all tunes I knew&mdash;and more&mdash;

Better—than Music! For I—who heard it


Better—than Music! For I—who heard it—

I was used—to the Birds—before—

This—was different—'Twas Translation—

Of all tunes I knew—and more—

'Twasn't contained—like other stanza—

No one could play it—the second time—

But the Composer—perfect Mozart—

Perish with him—that Keyless Rhyme!

So—Children—told how Brooks in Eden—

Bubbled a better—Melody—

Quaintly infer—Eve's great surrender—

Urging the feet—that would—not—fly—

Children—matured—are wiser—mostly—

Eden—a legend—dimly told—

Eve—and the Anguish—Grandame's story—

But—I was telling a tune—I heard—

Not such a strain—the Church—baptizes—

When the last Saint—goes up the Aisles—

Not such a stanza splits the silence—

When the Redemption strikes her Bells—

Let me not spill—its smallest cadence—

Humming—for promise—when alone—

Humming—until my faint Rehearsal—

Drop into tune—around the Throne—

Bird

A bird came down the walk:

He did not know I saw;

He bit an angle-worm in halves

And ate the fellow, raw.

And then he drank a dew

From a convenient grass,

And the hopped sideways to the wall

To let a beetle pass.

He glanced with rapid eyes

That hurried all abroad, -

They looked like frightened beads, I thought He stirred his velvet head.

Like one in danger; cautious,

I offered him a crumb,

And he unrolled his feathers

And rolled him softer home

Then oars divide the ocean,

Too silver for a seam,

Or butterflies, off banks of noon,

Leap, plashless, as they swim.

Emily Dickinson






Blazing in Gold and quenching in Purple Leaping like Leopards to the Sky

Then at the feet of the old Horizon

Laying her spotted Face to die

Stooping as low as the Otter's Window

Touching the Roof and tinting the Barn Kissing her Bonnet to the Meadow

And the Juggler of Day is gone

Emily Dickinson





Bless God, he went as soldiers


Bless God, he went as soldiers,

His musket on his breast&mdash;

Grant God, he charge the bravest

Of all the martial blest!

Please God, might I behold him

In epauletted white&mdash;

I should not fear the foe then&mdash; I should not fear the fight!

braind within its groove, The

The brain within its groove

Runs evenly and true;

But let a splinter swerve,

'T were easier for you

To put the water back

When floods have slit the hills,

And scooped a turnpike for themselves, And blotted out the mills!

Emily Dickinson





Bring me the sunset in a cup


Bring me the sunset in a cup,

Reckon the morning's flagons up

And say how many Dew,

Tell me how far the morning leaps&mdash; Tell me what time the weaver sleeps

Who spun the breadth of blue!

Write me how many notes there be

In the new Robin's ecstasy

Among astonished boughs&mdash;

How many trips the Tortoise makes&mdash; How many cups the Bee partakes,

The Debauchee of Dews!

Also, who laid the Rainbow's piers,

Also, who leads the docile spheres

By withes of supple blue?

Whose fingers string the stalactite&mdash; Who counts the wampum of the night

To see that none is due?

Who built this little Alban House

And shut the windows down so close

My spirit cannot see?

Who'll let me out some gala day

With implements to fly away,

Passing Pomposity?

Emily Dickinson





bustle in a house, The

The bustle in a house

The morning after death

Is solemnest of industries

Enacted upon earth,--

The sweeping up the heart,

And putting love away

We shall not want to use again

Until eternity.

By The Sea

I started early, took my dog,

And visited the sea;

The mermaids in the basement

Came out to look at me.

And frigates in the upper floor

Extended hempen hands,

Presuming me to be a mouse

Aground, upon the sands.

But no man moved me till the tide

Went past my simple shoe,

And past my apron and my belt,

And past my bodice too,

And made as he would eat me up

As wholly as a dew

Upon a dandelion's sleeve -

And then I started too.

And he - he followed close behind;

I felt his silver heel

Upon my ankle, - then my shoes

Would overflow with pearl.

Until we met the solid town,

No man he seemed to know;

And bowing with a mighty look

At me, the sea withdrew.

Emily Dickinson





Cat

She sights a Bird - she chuckles -

She flattens - then she crawls -

She runs without the look of feet -

Her eyes increase to Balls -

Her Jaws stir - twitching - hungry -

Her Teeth can hardly stand -

She leaps, but Robin leaped the first -

Ah, Pussy, of the Sand,

The Hopes so juicy ripening -

You almost bathed your Tongue -

When Bliss disclosed a hundred Toes -

And fled with every one -

Emily Dickinson





Chartless

I never saw a moor,

I never saw the sea;

Yet now I know how the heather looks,

And what a wave must be.

I never spoke with God,

Nor visited in Heaven;

Yet certain am I of the spot

As if the chart were given.

Emily Dickinson

Cocoon above! Cocoon below!


Cocoon above! Cocoon below!

Stealthy Cocoon, why hide you so

What all the world suspect?

An hour, and gay on every tree

Your secret, perched in ecstasy

Defies imprisonment!

An hour in Chrysalis to pass,

Then gay above receding grass

A Butterfly to go!

A moment to interrogate,

Then wiser than a "Surrogate,"

The Universe to know!

Emily Dickinson

Come Slowly

Come slowly,

Lips unused to thee.

Bashful, sip thy jasmines,

As the fainting bee,

Reaching late his flower,

Round her chamber hums,

Counts his nectars -alights,

And is lost in balms!

Could I but ride indefinite


Could I but ride indefinite

As doth the Meadow Bee

And visit only where I liked

And No one visit me

And flirt all Day with Buttercups

And marry whom I may

And dwell a little everywhere

Or better, run away

With no Police to follow

Or chase Him if He do

Till He should jump Peninsulas

To get away from me&mdash;

I said "But just to be a Bee"

Upon a Raft of Air

And row in Nowhere all Day long

And anchor "off the Bar"

What Liberty! So Captives deem

Who tight in Dungeons are.

Could contemplate the journey

With unpuzzled heart&mdash;

Such trust had one among us,

Among us not today&mdash;

We who saw the launching

Never sailed the Bay!

Crisis is a Hair


Crisis is a Hair

Toward which the forces creep

Past which forces retrograde

If it come in sleep

To suspend the Breath

Is the most we can

Ignorant is it Life or Death

Nicely balancing.

Let an instant push

Or an Atom press

Or a Circle hesitate

In Circumference

It&mdash;may jolt the Hand

That adjusts the Hair

That secures Eternity

From presenting&mdash;Here&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Crumbling is not an instant's Act


Crumbling is not an instant's Act

A fundamental pause

Dilapidation's processes

Are organized Decays.

'Tis first a Cobweb on the Soul

A Cuticle of Dust

A Borer in the Axis

An Elemental Rust&mdash;

Ruin is formal&mdash;Devil's work

Consecutive and slow&mdash;

Fail in an instant, no man did

Slipping&mdash;is Crash's law.

Dare you see a Soul at the White Heat?

Then crouch within the door&mdash; Red&mdash;is the Fire's common tint&mdash; But when the vivid Ore

Has vanquished Flame's conditions,

It quivers from the Forge

Without a color, but the light

Of unanointed Blaze.

Least Village has its Blacksmith

Whose Anvil's even ring

Stands symbol for the finer Forge

That soundless tugs&mdash;within&mdash; Refining these impatient Ores

With Hammer, and with Blaze

Until the Designated Light

Repudiate the Forge&mdash;

Death is a Dialogue between


Death is a Dialogue between

The Spirit and the Dust.

"Dissolve" says Death&mdash;The Spirit "Sir I have another Trust"&mdash;

Death doubts it&mdash;Argues from the Ground&mdash; The Spirit turns away

Just laying off for evidence

An Overcoat of Clay.

Emily Dickinson

Itself dissolved&mdash;of God&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Death leaves Us homesick, who behind


Death leaves Us homesick, who behind,

Except that it is gone

Are ignorant of its Concern

As if it were not born.

Through all their former Places, we

Like Individuals go

Who something lost, the seeking for

Is all that's left them, now&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Death sets a thing of signigicant

Death sets a thing significant

The eye had hurried by,

Except a perished creature

Entreat us tenderly

To ponder little workmanships

In crayon or in wool,

With 'This was last her fingers did,'

Industrious until

The thimble weighed too heavy,

The stitches stopped themselves,

And then 't was put among the dust

Upon the closet shelves.

A book I have, a friend gave,

Whose pencil, here and there,

Had notched the place that pleased him,--

At rest his fingers are.

Now, when I read, I read not,

For interrupting tears

Obliterate the etchings

Too costly for repairs.

The lawful Heir&mdash;for Thee&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Delayed till she had ceased to know


Delayed till she had ceased to know&mdash; Delayed till in its vest of snow

Her loving bosom lay&mdash;

An hour behind the fleeting breath&mdash; Later by just an hour than Death&mdash; Oh lagging Yesterday!

Could she have guessed that it would be&mdash; Could but a crier of the joy

Have climbed the distant hill&mdash; Had not the bliss so slow a pace

Who knows but this surrendered face

Were undefeated still?

Oh if there may departing be

Any forgot by Victory

In her imperial round&mdash;

Show them this meek appareled thing

That could not stop to be a king&mdash; Doubtful if it be crowned!

Delight becomes pictorial

Delight becomes pictorial

More fair, because impossible

The mountaln at a given distance

In amber lies;

Approached, the amber flits a little,--

And that's the skies!

Delight is as the flight


Delight is as the flight&mdash;

Flung colored, after Rain,

Would suit as bright,

Except that flight

Were Aliment&mdash;

"If it would last"

I asked the East,

When that Bent Stripe

Struck up my childish

Firmament&mdash;

And I, for glee,

Took Rainbows, as the common way,

And empty Skies

The Eccentricity&mdash;

And so with Lives&mdash;

And so with Butterflies&mdash;

Seen magic&mdash;through the fright That they will cheat the sight&mdash; And Dower latitudes far on&mdash;

Some sudden morn&mdash;

Our portion&mdash;in the fashion&mdash; Done&mdash;

Departed to the judgment,

Departed to the judgment,

A mighty afternoon;

Great clouds like ushers leaning,

Creation looking on.

The flesh surrendered, cancelled

The bodiless begun;

Two worlds, like audiences, disperse

And leave the soul alone.

Did you ever stand in a Cavern's Mouth&mdash; Widths out of the Sun&mdash;

And look&mdash;and shudder, and block your breath&mdash; And deem to be alone

In such a place, what horror,

How Goblin it would be&mdash;

And fly, as 'twere pursuing you?

Then Loneliness&mdash;looks so&mdash; Did you ever look in a Cannon's face&mdash; Between whose Yellow eye&mdash;

And yours&mdash;the Judgment intervened&mdash; The Question of "To die"&mdash; Extemporizing in your ear

As cool as Satyr's Drums&mdash;

If you remember, and were saved&mdash; It's liker so&mdash;it seems&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Distrustful of the Gentian


Distrustful of the Gentian&mdash;

And just to turn away,

The fluttering of her fringes

Child my perfidy&mdash;

Weary for my&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; I will singing go&mdash;

I shall not feel the sleet&mdash;then&mdash; I shall not fear the snow.

Flees so the phantom meadow

Before the breathless Bee&mdash;

So bubble brooks in deserts

On Ears that dying lie&mdash;

Burn so the Evening Spires

To Eyes that Closing go&mdash;

Hangs so distant Heaven&mdash;

To a hand below.

That there be standing here&mdash; A Sort, that shall not taste of Death&mdash; If Jesus was sincere&mdash;

I need no further Argue&mdash;

Is not a controvertible&mdash;

He told me, Death was dead&mdash;

Leave my Needle in the furrow&mdash; Where I put it down&mdash;

I can make the zigzag stitches

Straight&mdash;when I am strong&mdash; Till then&mdash;dreaming I am sewing Fetch the seam I missed&mdash;

Closer&mdash;so I&mdash;at my sleeping&mdash; Still surmise I stitch&mdash;

Doom is the House without the Door


Doom is the House without the Door&mdash;

'Tis entered from the Sun&mdash;

And then the Ladder's thrown away,

Because Escape&mdash;is done&mdash;

'Tis varied by the Dream

Of what they do outside&mdash;

Where Squirrels play&mdash;and Berries die&mdash; And Hemlocks&mdash;bow&mdash;to God&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Doubt Me! My Dim Companion!


Doubt Me! My Dim Companion!

Why, God, would be content

With but a fraction of the Life&mdash; Poured thee, without a stint&mdash; The whole of me&mdash;forever&mdash; What more the Woman can,

Say quick, that I may dower thee

With last Delight I own!

It cannot be my Spirit&mdash;

For that was thine, before&mdash;

I ceded all of Dust I knew&mdash;

What Opulence the more

Had I&mdash;a freckled Maiden,

Whose farthest of Degree,

Was&mdash;that she might&mdash; Some distant Heaven,

Dwell timidly, with thee!

Sift her, from Brow to Barefoot!

Strain till your last Surmise&mdash; Drop, like a Tapestry, away,

Before the Fire's Eyes&mdash;

Winnow her finest fondness&mdash;

But hallow just the snow

Intact, in Everlasting flake&mdash; Oh, Caviler, for you!

Emily Dickinson





Drab Habitation of Whom?


Drab Habitation of Whom?

Drama's Vitallest Expression is the Common Day That arise and set about Us&mdash; Other Tragedy

Perish in the Recitation&mdash;

This&mdash;the best enact

When the Audience is scattered

And the Boxes shut&mdash;

"Hamlet" to Himself were Hamlet&mdash; Had not Shakespeare wrote&mdash;

Though the "Romeo" left no Record Of his Juliet,

It were infinite enacted

In the Human Heart&mdash;

Only Theatre recorded

Owner cannot shut&mdash;

Dreams&mdash;are well&mdash;but Waking's better, If One wake at morn&mdash;

Dropped into the Ether Acre


Dropped into the Ether Acre&mdash; Wearing the Sod Gown&mdash;

Bonnet of Everlasting Laces&mdash; Brooch&mdash;frozen on&mdash;

Horses of Blonde&mdash;and Coach of Silver&mdash; Baggage a strapped Pearl&mdash;

Dust is the only Secret


Dust is the only Secret&mdash;

Death, the only One

You cannot find out all about

In his "native town."

Nobody know "his Father"&mdash; Never was a Boy&mdash;

Hadn't any playmates,

Or "Early history"&mdash; Industrious! Laconic!

Punctual! Sedate!

Bold as a Brigand!

Stiller than a Fleet!

Builds, like a Bird, too!

Christ robs the Nest&mdash;

Robin after Robin

Smuggled to Rest!

Emily Dickinson





Dying (I heard a fly buzz when I died) I heard a fly buzz when I died;

The stillness round my form

Was like the stillness in the air

Between the heaves of storm.

The eyes beside had wrung them dry,

And breaths were gathering sure

For that last onset, when the king

Be witnessed in his power.

I willed my keepsakes, signed away

What portion of me I

Could make assignable, -- and then

There interposed a fly,

With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,

Between the light and me;

And then the windows failed, and then

I could not see to see.

Emily Dickinson





Dying! Dying in the night!


Dying! Dying in the night!

Won't somebody bring the light

So I can see which way to go

Into the everlasting snow?

And "Jesus"! Where is Jesus gone?

They said that Jesus&mdash;always came&mdash; Perhaps he doesn't know the House&mdash; This way, Jesus, Let him pass!

Somebody run to the great gate

And see if Dollie's coming! Wait!

I hear her feet upon the stair!

Death won't hurt&mdash;now Dollie's here!

Emily Dickinson





Dying! To be afraid of thee


Dying! To be afraid of thee

One must to thine Artillery

Have left exposed a Friend&mdash;

Than thine old Arrow is a Shot

Delivered straighter to the Heart

The leaving Love behind.

Not for itself, the Dust is shy,

But, enemy, Beloved be

Thy Batteries divorce.

Fight sternly in a Dying eye

Two Armies, Love and Certainty

And Love and the Reverse.

Emily Dickinson





Each life converges to some centre

Each life converges to some centre

Expressed or still;

Exists in every human nature

A goal,

Admitted scarcely to itself, it may be, Too fair

For credibility's temerity

To dare.

Adored with caution, as a brittle heaven, To reach

Were hopeless as the rainbow's raiment To touch,

Yet persevered toward, surer for the distance; How high

Unto the saints' slow diligence

The sky!

Ungained, it may be, by a life's low venture, But then,

Eternity enables the endeavoring

Again.

Emily Dickinson





Each Scar I'll keep for Him


Each Scar I'll keep for Him

Instead I'll say of Gem

In His long Absence worn

A Costlier one

But every Tear I bore

Were He to count them o'er

His own would fall so more

I'll mis sum them.

Emily Dickinson





Each Second is the last


Each Second is the last

Perhaps, recalls the Man

Just measuring unconsciousness

The Sea and Spar between.

To fail within a Chance&mdash;

How terribler a thing

Than perish from the Chance's list

Before the Perishing!

Emily Dickinson





Elysium is as far as to

Elysium is as far as to

The very nearest Room

If in that Room a Friend await

Felicity or Doom--

What fortitude the Soul contains

That it can so endure

The accent of a coming Foot--

The opening of a Door--

Emily Dickinson





Embarrassment of one another


Embarrassment of one another

And God

Is Revelation's limit,

Aloud

Is nothing that is chief,

But still,

Divinity dwells under a seal.

Emily Dickinson





Empty my Heart, of Thee


Empty my Heart, of Thee&mdash;

Its single Artery&mdash;

Escaping backward to perceive


Escaping backward to perceive

The Sea upon our place&mdash;

Escaping forward, to confront

His glittering Embrace&mdash;

Retreating up, a Billow's height

Retreating blinded down

Our undermining feet to meet

Instructs to the Divine.

Emily Dickinson

Except the Heaven had come so near


Except the Heaven had come so near&mdash; So seemed to choose My Door&mdash; The Distance would not haunt me so&mdash; I had not hoped&mdash;before&mdash; But just to hear the Grace depart&mdash; I never thought to see&mdash;

Afflicts me with a Double loss&mdash;

'Tis lost&mdash;and lost to me&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Except to Heaven, she is nought


Except to Heaven, she is nought.

Except for Angels&mdash;lone.

Except to some wide-wandering Bee

A flower superfluous blown.

Except for winds&mdash;provincial.

Except by Butterflies

Unnoticed as a single dew

That on the Acre lies.

The smallest Housewife in the grass,

Yet take her from the Lawn

And somebody has lost the face

That made Existence&mdash;Home!

Emily Dickinson





Exclusion (The soul selects her own society) The soul selects her own society,

Then shuts the door;

On her divine majority

Obtrude no more.

Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing At her low gate;

Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling

Upon her mat.

I've known her from an ample nation

Choose one

Then close the valves of her attention Like stone.

Emily Dickinson





Exhilaration&mdash;is within


Exhilaration&mdash;is within&mdash; There can no Outer Wine

So royally intoxicate

As that diviner Brand

The Soul achieves&mdash;Herself&mdash; To drink&mdash;or set away

'Tis not of Holiday

To stimulate a Man

Who hath the Ample Rhine

Within his Closet&mdash;Best you can Exhale in offering.

Exultation is the going


Exultation is the going

Of an inland soul to sea,

Past the houses&mdash;past the headlands&mdash; Into deep Eternity&mdash;

Bred as we, among the mountains,

Can the sailor understand

The divine intoxication

Of the first league out from land?

Faith

"Faith" is a fine invention

When Gentlemen can see—

But Microscopes are prudent

In an Emergency.

Emily Dickinson






Faith&mdash;is the Pierless Bridge Supporting what We see

Unto the Scene that We do not&mdash; Too slender for the eye

It bears the Soul as bold

As it were rocked in Steel

With Arms of Steel at either side&mdash; It joins&mdash;behind the Veil

To what, could We presume

The Bridge would cease to be

To Our far, vacillating Feet

A first Necessity.

Fame is a fickle food


Fame is a fickle food

Upon a shifting plate

Whose table once a

Whose crumbs the crows inspect

And with ironic caw

Flap past it to the

Farmer's Corn&mdash;

Men eat of it and die.

First Robin

I dreaded that first robin so,

But he is mastered now,

And I'm accustomed to him grown,--

He hurts a little, though.

I thought if I could only live

Till that first shout got by,

Not all pianos in the woods

Had power to mangle me.

I dared not meet the daffodils,

For fear their yellow gown

Would pierce me with a fashion

So foreign to my own.

I wished the grass would hurry,

So when 't was time to see,

He'd be too tall, the tallest one

Could stretch to look at me.

I could not bear the bees should come, I wished they'd stay away

In those dim countries where they go:

What word had they for me?

They're here, though; not a creature failed, No blossom stayed away

In gentle deference to me,

The Queen of Calvary.

Each one salutes me as he goes,

And I my childish plumes

Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment

Of their unthinking drums.

Emily Dickinson





Fitter to see Him, I may be

For the long Hindrance&mdash;Grace&mdash;to Me&mdash; With Summers, and with Winters, grow,

Some passing Year&mdash;A trait bestow To make Me fairest of the Earth&mdash; The Waiting&mdash;then&mdash;will seem so worth I shall impute with half a pain

The blame that I was chosen&mdash;then&mdash; Time to anticipate His Gaze&mdash; It's first&mdash;Delight&mdash;and then&mdash;Surprise&mdash; The turning o'er and o'er my face

For Evidence it be the Grace&mdash; He left behind One Day&mdash;So less He seek Conviction, That&mdash;be This&mdash; I only must not grow so new

That He'll mistake&mdash;and ask for me Of me&mdash;when first unto the Door I go&mdash;to Elsewhere go no more&mdash; I only must not change so fair

He'll sigh&mdash;"The Other&mdash;She&mdash;is Where?"

The Love, tho', will array me right

I shall be perfect&mdash;in His sight&mdash; If He perceive the other Truth&mdash; Upon an Excellenter Youth&mdash;

How sweet I shall not lack in Vain&mdash; But gain&mdash;thro' loss&mdash;Through Grief&mdash;obtain&mdash; The Beauty that reward Him best&mdash; The Beauty of Demand&mdash;at Rest&mdash; Emily Dickinson






Flowers&mdash;Well&mdash;if anybody Can the ecstasy define&mdash;

Half a transport&mdash;half a trouble&mdash; With which flowers humble men:

Anybody find the fountain

From which floods so contra flow&mdash; I will give him all the Daisies

Which upon the hillside blow.

Too much pathos in their faces

For a simple breast like mine&mdash; Butterflies from St. Domingo

Cruising round the purple line&mdash; Have a system of aesthetics&mdash; Far superior to mine.

Perhaps of twig so fine&mdash;

To build upon the ground

Her modest house&mdash;

Yet who of all the throng

Dancing around the sun

Does so rejoice?

Frequently the wood are pink


Frequently the wood are pink&mdash; Frequently are brown.

Frequently the hills undress

Wonderful Rotation!

By but twelve performed!

We took the Mystery.

Further in Summer than the Birds


Further in Summer than the Birds

Pathetic from the Grass

A minor Nation celebrates

Its unobtrusive Mass.

No Ordinance be seen

So gradual the Grace

A pensive Custom it becomes

Enlarging Loneliness.

Antiquest felt at Noon

When August burning low

Arise this spectral Canticle

Repose to typify

Remit as yet no Grace

No Furrow on the Glow

Yet a Druidic Difference

Enhances Nature now

Glee—The great storm is over


Glee—The great storm is over—

Four—have recovered the Land—

Forty—gone down together—

Into the boiling Sand—

Ring—for the Scant Salvation—

Toll—for the bonnie Souls—

Neighbor—and friend—and Bridegroom—

Spinning upon the Shoals—

How they will tell the Story—

When Winter shake the Door—

Till the Children urge—

But the Forty—

Did they—come back no more?

Then a softness—suffuse the Story—

And a silence—the Teller's eye—

And the Children—no further question—

And only the Sea—reply—

Emily Dickinson





Glowing is her Bonnet


Glowing is her Bonnet,

Glowing is her Cheek,

Glowing is her Kirtle,

Yet she cannot speak.

Better as the Daisy

From the Summer hill

Vanish unrecorded

Save by tearful rill&mdash;

Save by loving sunrise

Looking for her face.

Save by feet unnumbered

Pausing at the place.

Emily Dickinson





God gave a loaf to every bird

God gave a loaf to every bird,

But just a crumb to me;

I dare not eat it, though I starve,--

My poignant luxury

To own it, touch it, prove the feat

That made the pellet mine,--

Too happy in my sparrow chance

For ampler coveting.

It might be famine all around,

I could not miss an ear,

Such plenty smiles upon my board,

My garner shows so fair.

I wonder how the rich may feel,--

An Indiaman--an Earl?

I deem that I with but a crumb

Am sovereign of them all.

God is a distant&mdash;stately Lover&mdash; Woos, as He states us&mdash;by His Son&mdash; Verily, a Vicarious Courtship&mdash;

"Miles", and "Priscilla", were such an One&mdash; But, lest the Soul&mdash;like fair "Priscilla"

Choose the Envoy&mdash;and spurn the Groom&mdash; Vouches, with hyperbolic archness&mdash;

"Miles", and "John Alden" were Synonym&mdash; Emily Dickinson

God made a little Gentian


God made a little Gentian&mdash;

It tried&mdash;to be a Rose&mdash; And failed&mdash;and all the Summer laughed&mdash; But just before the Snows

There rose a Purple Creature&mdash; That ravished all the Hill&mdash;

And Summer hid her Forehead&mdash; And Mockery&mdash;was still&mdash; The Frosts were her condition&mdash; The Tyrian would not come

Until the North&mdash;invoke it&mdash; Creator&mdash;Shall I&mdash;bloom?

Emily Dickinson





God made a little gentian;

God made a little gentian;

It tried to be a rose

And failed, and all the summer laughed.

But just before the snows

There came a purple creature

That ravished all the hill;

And summer hid her forehead,

And mockery was still.

The frosts were her condition;

The Tyrian would not come

Until the North evoked it.

"Creator! shall I bloom?"

God permit industrious angels

God permit industrious angels

Afternoons to play.

I met one, -- forgot my school-mates,

All, for him, straightaway.

God calls home the angels promptly

At the setting sun;

I missed mine. How dreary marbles,

After playing the Crown!

Emily Dickinson

Going to Heaven!


Going to Heaven!

I don't know when&mdash;

Pray do not ask me how!

Indeed I'm too astonished

To think of answering you!

Going to Heaven!

How dim it sounds!

And yet it will be done

As sure as flocks go home at night

Unto the Shepherd's arm!

Perhaps you're going too!

Who knows?

If you should get there first

Save just a little space for me

Close to the two I lost&mdash;

The smallest "Robe" will fit me And just a bit of "Crown"&mdash; For you know we do not mind our dress

When we are going home&mdash;

I'm glad I don't believe it

For it would stop my breath&mdash; And I'd like to look a little more

At such a curious Earth!

I'm glad they did believe it

Whom I have never found

Since the might Autumn afternoon

I left them in the ground.

Emily Dickinson





Going to Him! Happy letter!


Going to Him! Happy letter!

Tell Him&mdash;

Tell Him the page I didn't write&mdash; Tell Him&mdash;I only said the Syntax&mdash; And left the Verb and the pronoun out&mdash; Tell Him just how the fingers hurried&mdash; Then&mdash;how they waded&mdash;slow&mdash;slow&mdash; And then you wished you had eyes in your pages&mdash; So you could see what moved them so&mdash; Tell Him&mdash;it wasn't a Practised Writer&mdash; You guessed&mdash;from the way the sentence toiled&mdash; You could hear the Bodice tug, behind you&mdash; As if it held but the might of a child&mdash; You almost pitied it&mdash;you&mdash;it worked so&mdash; Tell Him&mdash;no&mdash;you may quibble there&mdash; For it would split His Heart, to know it&mdash; And then you and I, were silenter.

Tell Him&mdash;Night finished&mdash;before we finished&mdash; And the Old Clock kept neighing "Day"!

And you&mdash;got sleepy&mdash;and begged to be ended&mdash; What could it hinder so&mdash;to say?

Tell Him&mdash;just how she sealed you&mdash;Cautious!

But&mdash;if He ask where you are hid Until tomorrow&mdash;Happy letter!

Gesture Coquette&mdash;and shake your Head!

Emily Dickinson





Going to him! Happy letter! Tell him--

Going to him! Happy letter! Tell him--

Tell him the page I didn't write;

Tell him I only said the syntax,

And left the verb and the pronoun out.

Tell him just how the fingers hurried

Then how they waded, slow, slow, slow-

And then you wished you had eyes in your pages, So you could see what moved them so.

'Tell him it wasn't a practised writer, You guessed, from the way the sentence toiled; You could hear the bodice tug, behind you, As if it held but the might of a child; You almost pitied it, you, it worked so.

Tell him--No, you may quibble there,

For it would split his heart to know it, And then you and I were silenter.

'Tell him night finished before we finished And the old clock kept neighing 'day!'

And you got sleepy and begged to be ended--

What could it hinder so, to say?

Tell him just how she sealed you, cautious But if he ask where you are hid

Until to-morrow,--happy letter!

Gesture, coquette, and shake your head!'

Emily Dickinson





Good Morning&mdash;Midnight


Good Morning&mdash;Midnight&mdash; I'm coming Home&mdash;

Day&mdash;got tired of Me&mdash; How could I&mdash;of Him?

Sunshine was a sweet place&mdash;

I liked to stay&mdash;

But Morn&mdash;didn't want me&mdash;now&mdash; So&mdash;Goodnight&mdash;Day!

I can look&mdash;can't I&mdash; When the East is Red?

Day—got tired of Me—

How could I—of Him?

Good night! which put the candle out?

Good night! which put the candle out?

A jealous zephyr, not a doubt.

Ah! friend, you little knew

How long at that celestial wick

The angels labored diligent;

Extinguished, now, for you!

It might have been the lighthouse spark Some sailor, rowing in the dark,

Had importuned to see!

It might have been the waning lamp

That lit the drummer from the camp

To purer reveille!

Emily Dickinson





Good night, because we must


Good night, because we must,

How intricate the dust!

I would go, to know!

Oh incognito!

Saucy, Saucy Seraph

To elude me so!

Father! they won't tell me,

Won't you tell them to?

Emily Dickinson





Good to hide, and hear 'em hunt!


Good to hide, and hear 'em hunt!

Better, to be found,

If one care to, that is,

The Fox fits the Hound&mdash;

Good to know, and not tell,

Best, to know and tell,

Can one find the rare Ear

Not too dull&mdash;

Emily Dickinson






Gratitude&mdash;is not the mention Of a Tenderness,

But its still appreciation

Out of Plumb of Speech.

When the Sea return no Answer

By the Line and Lead

Proves it there's no Sea, or rather

A remoter Bed?

Emily Dickinson

Grief is a Mouse


Grief is a Mouse&mdash;

And chooses Wainscot in the Breast

For His Shy House&mdash;

And baffles quest&mdash;

Grief is a Thief&mdash;quick startled&mdash; Pricks His Ear&mdash;report to hear Of that Vast Dark&mdash;

Possibly&mdash;if they refuse&mdash;How then know&mdash; Since a Rack couldn't coax a syllable&mdash;now.

Growth of Man&mdash;like Growth of Nature&mdash; Gravitates within&mdash;

Atmosphere, and Sun endorse it&mdash; Bit it stir&mdash;alone&mdash; Each&mdash;its difficult Ideal

Must achieve&mdash;Itself&mdash; Through the solitary prowess

Of a Silent Life&mdash;

Effort&mdash;is the sole condition&mdash; Patience of Itself&mdash;

Patience of opposing forces&mdash; And intact Belief&mdash;

Looking on&mdash;is the Department Of its Audience&mdash;

But Transaction&mdash;is assisted

By no Countenance&mdash;

Had I not This, or This, I said


Had I not This, or This, I said,

Appealing to Myself,

In moment of prosperity&mdash;

Inadequate&mdash;were Life&mdash;

"Thou hast not Me, nor Me"&mdash;it said, In Moment of Reverse&mdash;

"And yet Thou art industrious&mdash; No need&mdash;hadst Thou&mdash;of us"?

My need&mdash;was all I had&mdash;I said&mdash; The need did not reduce&mdash;

Because the food&mdash;exterminate&mdash; The hunger&mdash;does not cease&mdash; But diligence&mdash;is sharper&mdash; Proportioned to the Chance&mdash;

To feed upon the Retrograde&mdash; Enfeebles&mdash;the Advance&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Had I presumed to hope


Had I presumed to hope&mdash;

The loss had been to Me

A Value&mdash;for the Greatness' Sake&mdash; As Giants&mdash;gone away&mdash; Had I presumed to gain

The failure but confirm the Grace

In further Infinite&mdash;

'Tis failure&mdash;not of Hope&mdash; But Confident Despair&mdash;

Advancing on Celestial Lists&mdash; With faint&mdash;Terrestial power&mdash;

Have any like Myself


Have any like Myself

Investigating March,

New Houses on the Hill descried&mdash; And possibly a Church&mdash;

That were not, We are sure&mdash;

As lately as the Snow&mdash;

And are Today&mdash;if We exist&mdash; Though how may this be so?

Have any like Myself

Conjectured Who may be

The Occupants of the Adobes&mdash; So easy to the Sky&mdash;

'Twould seem that God should be

The nearest Neighbor to&mdash;

And Heaven&mdash;a convenient Grace For Show, or Company&mdash;

Have any like Myself

Preserved the Charm secure

By shunning carefully the Place

All Seasons of the Year,

Excepting March&mdash;'Tis then

My Villages be seen&mdash;

And possibly a Steeple&mdash;

Not afterward&mdash;by Men&mdash; Emily Dickinson






Have you got a Brook in your little heart, Where bashful flowers blow,

And blushing birds go down to drink,

And shadows tremble so&mdash;

And nobody knows, so still it flows,

That any brook is there,

And yet your little draught of life

Is daily drunken there&mdash;

Why, look out for the little brook in March, When the rivers overflow,

And the snows come hurrying from the fills, And the bridges often go&mdash;

And later, in August it may be&mdash; When the meadows parching lie,

Beware, lest this little brook of life, Some burning noon go dry!

He forgot&mdash;and I&mdash;remembered&mdash;

'Twas an everyday affair&mdash;

Long ago as Christ and Peter&mdash;

"Warmed them" at the "Temple fire."

"Thou wert with him"&mdash;quoth "the Damsel"?

"No"&mdash;said Peter, 'twasn't me&mdash; Jesus merely "looked" at Peter&mdash; Could I do aught else&mdash;to Thee?

He fought like those Who've nought to lose&mdash; Bestowed Himself to Balls

As One who for a further Life

Had not a further Use&mdash;

Invited Death&mdash;with bold attempt&mdash; But Death was Coy of Him

As Other Men, were Coy of Death&mdash; To Him&mdash;to live&mdash;was Doom&mdash; His Comrades, shifted like the Flakes

When Gusts reverse the Snow&mdash; But He&mdash;was left alive Because Of Greediness to die&mdash;

He fumbles at your Soul


He fumbles at your Soul

As Players at the Keys

Before they drop full Music on&mdash; He stuns you by degrees&mdash;

Prepares your brittle Nature

For the Ethereal Blow

By fainter Hammers&mdash;further heard&mdash; Then nearer&mdash;Then so slow

Your Breath has time to straighten&mdash; Your Brain&mdash;to bubble Cool&mdash; Deals&mdash;One&mdash;imperial&mdash;Thunderbolt&mdash; That scalps your naked Soul&mdash; When Winds take Forests in the Paws&mdash; The Universe&mdash;is still&mdash; Emily Dickinson





He fumbles at your spirit

He fumbles at your spirit

As players at the keys

Before they drop full music on;

He stuns you by degrees,

Prepares your brittle substance

For the ethereal blow,

By fainter hammers, further heard,

Then nearer, then so slow

Your breath has time to straighten,

Your brain to bubble cool, --

Deals one imperial thunderbolt

That scalps your naked soul.

Emily Dickinson





He gave away his Life


He gave away his Life&mdash;

To Us&mdash;Gigantic Sum&mdash; A trifle&mdash;in his own esteem&mdash; But magnified&mdash;by Fame&mdash; Until it burst the Hearts

That fancied they could hold&mdash; When swift it slipped its limit&mdash; And on the Heavens&mdash;unrolled&mdash;

'Tis Ours&mdash;to wince&mdash;and weep&mdash; And wonder&mdash;and decay

By Blossoms gradual process&mdash; He chose&mdash;Maturity&mdash; And quickening&mdash;as we sowed&mdash; Just obviated Bud&mdash;

And when We turned to note the Growth&mdash; Broke&mdash;perfect&mdash;from the Pod&mdash; Emily Dickinson





He outstripped Time with but a Bout


He outstripped Time with but a Bout,

He outstripped Stars and Sun

And then, unjaded, challenged God

In presence of the Throne.

And He and He in mighty List

Unto this present, run,

The larger Glory for the less

A just sufficient Ring.

Emily Dickinson






He parts Himself&mdash;like Leaves&mdash; And then&mdash;He closes up&mdash; Then stands upon the Bonnet

Of Any Buttercup&mdash;

And then He runs against

And oversets a Rose&mdash;

And then does Nothing&mdash;

Then away upon a Jib&mdash;He goes&mdash; And dangles like a Mote

Suspended in the Noon&mdash;

Uncertain&mdash;to return Below&mdash; Or settle in the Moon&mdash;

What come of Him&mdash;at Night&mdash; The privilege to say

Be limited by Ignorance&mdash;

What come of Him&mdash;That Day&mdash; The Frost&mdash;possess the World&mdash; In Cabinets&mdash;be shown&mdash; A Sepulchre of quaintest Floss&mdash; An Abbey&mdash;a Cocoon&mdash; Emily Dickinson

He put the Belt around my life


He put the Belt around my life

I heard the Buckle snap&mdash;

And turned away, imperial,

My Lifetime folding up&mdash;

Deliberate, as a Duke would do

A Kingdom's Title Deed&mdash;

Henceforth, a Dedicated sort&mdash; A Member of the Cloud.

Yet not too far to come at call&mdash; And do the little Toils

That make the Circuit of the Rest&mdash; And deal occasional smiles

To lives that stoop to notice mine&mdash; And kindly ask it in&mdash;

Whose invitation, know you not

For Whom I must decline?

Emily Dickinson





He strained my faith


He strained my faith&mdash;

Did he find it supple?

Shook my strong trust&mdash;

Did it then&mdash;yield?

Hurled my belief&mdash;

But&mdash;did he shatter&mdash;it?

Racked&mdash;with suspense&mdash; Not a nerve failed!

Wrung me&mdash;with Anguish&mdash; But I never doubted him&mdash;

'Tho' for what wrong

He did never say&mdash;

Stabbed&mdash;while I sued

His sweet forgiveness&mdash;

Jesus&mdash;it's your little "John"!

Don't you know&mdash;me?

Emily Dickinson





He told a homely tale


He told a homely tale

And spotted it with tears&mdash;

Upon his infant face was set

The Cicatrice of years&mdash;

All crumpled was the cheek

No other kiss had known

Than flake of snow, divided with

The Redbreast of the Barn&mdash;

If Mother&mdash;in the Grave&mdash; Or Father&mdash;on the Sea&mdash; Or Father in the Firmament&mdash;

Or Brethren, had he&mdash;

If Commonwealth below,

Or Commonwealth above

Have missed a Barefoot Citizen&mdash; I've ransomed it&mdash;alive&mdash; Emily Dickinson





He touched me, so I live to know


He touched me, so I live to know

That such a day, permitted so,

I groped upon his breast&mdash;

It was a boundless place to me

And silenced, as the awful sea

Puts minor streams to rest.

And now, I'm different from before,

As if I breathed superior air&mdash; Or brushed a Royal Gown&mdash;

My feet, too, that had wandered so&mdash; My Gypsy face&mdash;transfigured now&mdash; To tenderer Renown&mdash;

Into this Port, if I might come,

Rebecca, to Jerusalem,

Would not so ravished turn&mdash;

Nor Persian, baffled at her shrine

Lift such a Crucifixial sign

To her imperial Sun.

Emily Dickinson






He was weak, and I was strong&mdash;then&mdash; So He let me lead him in&mdash;

I was weak, and He was strong then&mdash; So I let him lead me&mdash;Home.

'Twasn't far&mdash;the door was near&mdash;

'Twasn't dark&mdash;for He went&mdash;too&mdash;

'Twasn't loud, for He said nought&mdash; That was all I cared to know.

Day knocked&mdash;and we must part&mdash; Neither&mdash;was strongest&mdash;now&mdash; He strove&mdash;and I strove&mdash;too&mdash; We didn't do it&mdash;tho'!

He who in Himself believes


He who in Himself believes&mdash;

Fraud cannot presume&mdash;

Faith is Constancy's Result&mdash; And assumes&mdash;from Home&mdash; Cannot perish, though it fail

But defaced Vicariously&mdash;

For Some Other Shame&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Heart! We will forget him!


Heart! We will forget him!

You and I&mdash;tonight!

You may forget the warmth he gave&mdash; I will forget the light!

When you have done, pray tell me

That I may straight begin!

Haste! lest while you're lagging

I remember him!

Emily Dickinson





Heart, not so heavy as mine


Heart, not so heavy as mine

Wending late home&mdash;

As it passed my window

Whistled itself a tune&mdash;

A careless snatch&mdash;a ballad&mdash;A ditty of the street&mdash; Yet to my irritated Ear

An Anodyne so sweet&mdash;

It was as if a Bobolink

Sauntering this way

Carolled, and paused, and carolled&mdash; Then bubbled slow away!

It was as if a chirping brook

Upon a dusty way&mdash;

Set bleeding feet to minuets

Without the knowing why!

Tomorrow, night will come again&mdash; Perhaps, weary and sore&mdash;

Ah Bugle! By my window

I pray you pass once more.

Emily Dickinson





Heart, We Will Forget Him

Heart, we will forget him,

You and I, tonight!

You must forget the warmth he gave,

I will forget the light.

When you have done pray tell me,

Then I, my thoughts, will dim.

Haste! ‘lest while you’re lagging

I may remember him!

Emily Dickinson





Heaven


"Heaven" has different Signs—to me—

Sometimes, I think that Noon

Is but a symbol of the Place—

And when again, at Dawn,

A mighty look runs round the World

And settles in the Hills—

An Awe if it should be like that

Upon the Ignorance steals—

The Orchard, when the Sun is on—

The Triumph of the Birds

When they together Victory make—

Some Carnivals of Clouds—

The Rapture of a finished Day—

Returning to the West—

All these—remind us of the place

That Men call "paradise"—

Itself be fairer—we suppose—

But how Ourself, shall be

Adorned, for a Superior Grace—

Not yet, our eyes can see—

Heaven is what I cannot reach!

Heaven is what I cannot reach!

The apple on the tree,

Provided it do hopelss hang,

That 'heaven' is, to me.

The color on the cruising cloud,

The interdicted ground

Behind the hill, the house behind, --

There Paradise is found!

Emily Dickinson





Heaven—is what I cannot reach!

Provided it do hopeless—hang—

That—"Heaven" is—to Me!

The Color, on the Cruising Cloud—

The interdicted Land—

Behind the Hill—the House behind—

There—Paradise—is found!

Her teasing Purples—Afternoons—

The credulous—decoy—

Enamored—of the Conjuror—

That spurned us—Yesterday!

Poets—ended—

Silver—perished—with her Tongue—

Flute—or Woman—

So divine—

Not unto its Summer—Morning

Gushed too free for the Adoring—

From the Anglo-Florentine—

Late—the Praise—

'Tis dull—conferring

On the Head too High to Crown—

Diadem—or Ducal Showing—

Be its Grave—sufficient sign—

Nought—that We—No Poet's Kinsman—

Suffocate—with easy woe—

What, and if, Ourself a Bridegroom—

Put Her down—in Italy?

Her breast is fit for pearls


Her breast is fit for pearls,

But I was not a "Diver"&mdash; Her brow is fit for thrones

But I have not a crest.

Her heart is fit for home&mdash;

I&mdash;a Sparrow&mdash;build there Sweet of twigs and twine

My perennial nest.

Her final Summer was it


Her final Summer was it&mdash;

And yet We guessed it not&mdash;

If tenderer industriousness

Pervaded Her, We thought

A further force of life

Developed from within&mdash;

When Death lit all the shortness up

It made the hurry plain&mdash;

We wondered at our blindness

When nothing was to see

But Her Carrara Guide post&mdash;

At Our Stupidity&mdash;

When duller than our dullness

The Busy Darling lay&mdash;

So busy was she&mdash;finishing&mdash; So leisurely&mdash;were We&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Her final summer was it,

Her final summer was it,

And yet we guessed it not;

If tenderer industriousness

Pervaded her, we thought

A further force of life

Developed from within,--

When Death lit all the shortness up,

And made the hurry plain.

We wondered at our blindness,--

When nothing was to see

But her Carrara guide-post,--

At our stupidity

When, duller than our dulness,

The busy darling lay,

So busy was she, finishing,

So leisurely were we!

Emily Dickinson





Her Grace is all she has—


Her Grace is all she has—

And that, so least displays—

One Art to recognize, must be,

Another Art, to praise.

Emily Dickinson





Her Grace is all she has&mdash;


Her Grace is all she has&mdash;

And that, so least displays&mdash; One Art to recognize, must be,

Another Art, to praise.

Her smile was shaped like other smiles&mdash; The Dimples ran along&mdash;

And still it hurt you, as some Bird

Did hoist herself, to sing,

Then recollect a Ball, she got&mdash; And hold upon the Twig,

Convulsive, while the Music broke&mdash; Like Beads&mdash;among the Bog&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Her Sweet turn to leave the Homestead


Her Sweet turn to leave the Homestead

Came the Darker Way&mdash;

Carriages&mdash;Be Sure&mdash;and Guests&mdash;too&mdash; But for Holiday

'Tis more pitiful Endeavor

Than did Loaded Sea

O'er the Curls attempt to caper

It had cast away&mdash;

Never Bride had such Assembling&mdash; Never kinsmen kneeled

To salute so fair a Forehead&mdash; Garland be indeed&mdash;

Fitter Feet&mdash;of Her before us&mdash; Than whatever Brow

Art of Snow&mdash;or Trick of Lily Possibly bestow

Of Her Father&mdash;Whoso ask Her&mdash; He shall seek as high

As the Palm&mdash;that serve the Desert&mdash; To obtain the Sky&mdash;

Distance&mdash;be Her only Motion&mdash; If 'tis Nay&mdash;or Yes&mdash; Acquiescence&mdash;or Demurral&mdash; Whosoever guess&mdash;

He&mdash;must pass the Crystal Angle That obscure Her face&mdash;

He&mdash;must have achieved in person Equal Paradise&mdash;

Her sweet Weight on my Heart a Night


Her sweet Weight on my Heart a Night

Had scarcely deigned to lie&mdash; When, stirring, for Belief's delight,

My Bride had slipped away&mdash;

If 'twas a Dream&mdash;made solid&mdash;just The Heaven to confirm&mdash;

Or if Myself were dreamed of Her&mdash; The power to presume&mdash;

With Him remain&mdash;who unto Me&mdash; Gave&mdash;even as to All&mdash; A Fiction superseding Faith&mdash; By so much&mdash;as 'twas real&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Her&mdash;"last Poems"


Her&mdash;"last Poems"&mdash; Poets&mdash;ended&mdash;

Silver&mdash;perished&mdash;with her Tongue&mdash; Not on Record&mdash;bubbled other, Flute&mdash;or Woman&mdash;

So divine&mdash;

Not unto its Summer&mdash;Morning

Robin&mdash;uttered Half the Tune&mdash; Gushed too free for the Adoring&mdash; From the Anglo-Florentine&mdash;

Late&mdash;the Praise&mdash;

'Tis dull&mdash;conferring

On the Head too High to Crown&mdash; Diadem&mdash;or Ducal Showing&mdash; Be its Grave&mdash;sufficient sign&mdash; Nought&mdash;that We&mdash;No Poet's Kinsman&mdash; Suffocate&mdash;with easy woe&mdash; What, and if, Ourself a Bridegroom&mdash; Put Her down&mdash;in Italy?

Herein a Blossom lies


Herein a Blossom lies&mdash;

A Sepulchre, between&mdash;

Cross it, and overcome the Bee&mdash; Remain&mdash;'tis but a Rind.

His Bill an Auger is


His Bill an Auger is,

His Head, a Cap and Frill.

He laboreth at every Tree

A Worm, His utmost Goal.

Emily Dickinson





His Feet are shod with Gauze


His Feet are shod with Gauze&mdash; His Helmet, is of Gold,

His Breast, a Single Onyx

With Chrysophrase, inlaid.

His Labor is a Chant&mdash;

His Idleness&mdash;a Tune&mdash; Oh, for a Bee's experience

Of Clovers, and of Noon!

Emily Dickinson





Home

Years I had been from home,

And now, before the door

I dared not open, lest a face

I never saw before

Stare vacant into mine

And ask my business there.

My business, - just a life I left,

Was such still dwelling there?

I fumbled at my nerve,

I scanned the windows near;

The silence like an ocean rolled,

And broke against my ear.

I laughed a wooden laugh

That I could fear a door,

Who danger and the dead had faced,

But never quaked before.

I fitted to the latch

My hand, with trembling care,

Lest back the awful door should spring, And leave me standing there.

I moved my fingers off

As cautiously as glass,

And held my ears, and like a thief

Fled gasping from the house.

Emily Dickinson





Hope is the thing with feathers

Hope is the thing with feathers

That perches in the soul,

And sings the tune without the words,

And never stops at all,

And sweetest in the gale is heard;

And sore must be the storm

That could abash the little bird

That kept so many warm.

I've heard it in the chillest land,

And on the strangest sea;

Yet, never, in extremity,

It asked a crumb of me.

Emily Dickinson





Hope is the thing with feathers—

"Hope" is the thing with feathers—

That perches in the soul—

And sings the tune without the words—

And never stops—at all—

And sweetest—in the Gale—is heard—

And sore must be the storm—

That could abash the little Bird

That kept so many warm—

I've heard it in the chillest land—

And on the strangest Sea—

Yet, never, in Extremity,

It asked a crumb—of Me.

Emily Dickinson





Houses—so the Wise Men tell me—

"Houses"—so the Wise Men tell me—

"Mansions"! Mansions must be warm!

Mansions cannot let the tears in,

Mansions must exclude the storm!

"Many Mansions," by "his Father,"

I don't know him; snugly built!

Could the Children find the way there—

Some, would even trudge tonight!

Emily Dickinson





How far is it to Heaven?


How far is it to Heaven?

As far as Death this way&mdash;

Of River or of Ridge beyond

Was no discovery.

How far is it to Hell?

As far as Death this way&mdash;

How far left hand the Sepulchre

Defies Topography.

Emily Dickinson





How fortunate the Grave


How fortunate the Grave&mdash;

All Prizes to obtain&mdash;

Successful certain, if at last,

First Suitor not in vain.

Emily Dickinson





How happy I was if I could forget


How happy I was if I could forget

To remember how sad I am

Would be an easy adversity

But the recollecting of Bloom

Keeps making November difficult

Till I who was almost bold

Lose my way like a little Child

And perish of the cold.

Emily Dickinson





How happy is the little Stone


How happy is the little Stone

That rambles in the Road alone,

And doesn't care about Careers

And Exigencies never fears&mdash;

Whose Coat of elemental Brown

A passing Universe put on,

And independent as the Sun

Associates or glows alone,

Fulfilling absolute Decree

In casual simplicity&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





How many Flowers fail in Wood


How many Flowers fail in Wood&mdash; Or perish from the Hill&mdash;

Without the privilege to know

That they are Beautiful&mdash;

How many cast a nameless Pod

Upon the nearest Breeze&mdash;

Unconscious of the Scarlet Freight&mdash; It bear to Other Eyes&mdash;

Emily Dickinson






How many times these low feet staggered&mdash; Only the soldered mouth can tell&mdash; Try&mdash;can you stir the awful rivet&mdash; Try&mdash;can you lift the hasps of steel!

Stroke the cool forehead&mdash;hot so often&mdash; Lift&mdash;if you care&mdash;the listless hair&mdash; Handle the adamantine fingers

Never a thimble&mdash;more&mdash;shall wear&mdash; Buzz the dull flies&mdash;on the chamber window&mdash; Brave&mdash;shines the sun through the freckled pane&mdash; Fearless&mdash;the cobweb swings from the ceiling&mdash; Indolent Housewife&mdash;in Daisies&mdash;lain!

Emily Dickinson





How noteless Men, and Pleiads, stand


How noteless Men, and Pleiads, stand,

Until a sudden sky

Reveals the fact that One is rapt

Forever from the Eye&mdash;

Members of the Invisible,

Existing, while we stare,

In Leagueless Opportunity,

O'ertakenless, as the Air&mdash;

Why didn't we detain Them?

The Heavens with a smile,

Sweep by our disappointed Heads

Without a syllable&mdash;

Emily Dickinson






How sick&mdash;to wait&mdash;in any place&mdash;but thine&mdash; I knew last night&mdash;when someone tried to twine&mdash; Thinking&mdash;perhaps&mdash;that I looked tired&mdash;or alone&mdash; Or breaking&mdash;almost&mdash;with unspoken pain&mdash; And I turned&mdash;ducal&mdash; That right&mdash;was thine&mdash; One port&mdash;suffices&mdash;for a Brig&mdash;like mine&mdash; Ours be the tossing&mdash;wild though the sea&mdash; Rather than a Mooring&mdash;unshared by thee.

Ours be the Cargo&mdash;unladed&mdash;here&mdash; Rather than the "spicy isles&mdash;"

And thou&mdash;not there&mdash; Emily Dickinson






How sick—to wait—in any place—but thine—

I knew last night—when someone tried to twine—

Thinking—perhaps—that I looked tired—or alone—

Or breaking—almost—with unspoken pain—

And I turned—ducal—

That right—was thine—

One port—suffices—for a Brig—like mine—

Ours be the tossing—wild though the sea—

Rather than a Mooring—unshared by thee.

Ours be the Cargo—unladed—here—

Rather than the "spicy isles—"

And thou—not there—

Emily Dickinson






How the old Mountains drip with Sunset How the Hemlocks burn&mdash;

How the Dun Brake is draped in Cinder

By the Wizard Sun&mdash;

How the old Steeples hand the Scarlet

Till the Ball is full&mdash;

Have I the lip of the Flamingo

That I dare to tell?

Then, how the Fire ebbs like Billows&mdash; Touching all the Grass

With a departing&mdash;Sapphire&mdash;feature&mdash; As a Duchess passed&mdash;

How a small Dusk crawls on the Village Till the Houses blot

And the odd Flambeau, no men carry

Glimmer on the Street&mdash;

How it is Night&mdash;in Nest and Kennel&mdash; And where was the Wood&mdash;

Just a Dome of Abyss is Bowing

Into Solitude&mdash;

These are the Visions flitted Guido&mdash; Titian&mdash;never told&mdash; Domenichino dropped his pencil&mdash; Paralyzed, with Gold&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





How the Waters closed above Him


How the Waters closed above Him

We shall never know&mdash;

How He stretched His Anguish to us

That&mdash;is covered too&mdash; Spreads the Pond Her Base of Lilies

Bold above the Boy

Whose unclaimed Hat and Jacket

Sum the History&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





How well I knew Her not


How well I knew Her not

Whom not to know has been

A Bounty in prospective, now

Next Door to mine the Pain.

I am alive&mdash;I guess


I am alive&mdash;I guess&mdash; The Branches on my Hand

I asked no other thing


I asked no other thing&mdash;

No other&mdash;was denied&mdash; I offered Being&mdash;for it&mdash; The Mighty Merchant sneered&mdash; Brazil? He twirled a Button&mdash; Without a glance my way&mdash;

"But&mdash;Madam&mdash;is there nothing else&mdash; That We can show&mdash;Today?"

Emily Dickinson





I breathed enough to learn the trick,

I breathed enough to learn the trick,

And now, removed from air,

I simulate the breath so well,

That one, to be quite sure

The lungs are stirless, must descend

Among the cunning cells,

And touch the pantomime himself.

How cool the bellows feels!

Emily Dickinson

Emily Dickinson





I bring an unaccustomed wine


I bring an unaccustomed wine

To lips long parching

Next to mine,

And summon them to drink;

Crackling with fever, they Essay,

I turn my brimming eyes away,

And come next hour to look.

The hands still hug the tardy glass&mdash; The lips I would have cooled, alas&mdash; Are so superfluous Cold&mdash;

I would as soon attempt to warm

The bosoms where the frost has lain

Ages beneath the mould&mdash;

Some other thirsty there may be

To whom this would have pointed me

Had it remained to speak&mdash;

And so I always bear the cup

If, haply, mine may be the drop

Some pilgrim thirst to slake&mdash; If, haply, any say to me

"Unto the little, unto me,"

When I at last awake.

Emily Dickinson





I Came to buy a smile&mdash;today


I Came to buy a smile&mdash;today&mdash; But just a single smile&mdash;

The smallest one upon your face

Will suit me just as well&mdash;

The one that no one else would miss

It shone so very small&mdash;

I'm pleading at the "counter"&mdash;sir&mdash; Could you afford to sell&mdash;

I've Diamonds&mdash;on my fingers&mdash; You know what Diamonds are?

I've Rubies&mdash;live the Evening Blood&mdash; And Topaz&mdash;like the star!

'Twould be "a Bargain" for a Jew!

Say&mdash;may I have it&mdash;Sir?

I can wade Grief


I can wade Grief&mdash;

Whole Pools of it&mdash;

I'm used to that&mdash;

But the least push of Joy

Breaks up my feet&mdash;

And I tip&mdash;drunken&mdash; Let no Pebble&mdash;smile&mdash;

'Twas the New Liquor&mdash;

That was all!

Power is only Pain&mdash;

Stranded, thro' Discipline,

Till Weights&mdash;will hang&mdash; Give Balm&mdash;to Giants&mdash; And they'll wilt, like Men&mdash;

Give Himmaleh&mdash;

They'll Carry&mdash;Him!

Emily Dickinson





I cannot be ashamed


I cannot be ashamed

Because I cannot see

The love you offer&mdash;

Magnitude

Reverses Modesty

And I cannot be proud

Because a Height so high

Involves Alpine

Requirements

And Services of Snow.

Emily Dickinson






I cannot buy it&mdash;'tis not sold&mdash; There is no other in the World&mdash; Mine was the only one

I was so happy I forgot

To shut the Door And it went out

And I am all alone&mdash;

If I could find it Anywhere

I would not mind the journey there

Though it took all my store

But just to look it in the Eye&mdash;

"Did'st thou?" "Thou did'st not mean," to say, Then, turn my Face away.

I cannot dance upon my Toes


I cannot dance upon my Toes&mdash; No Man instructed me&mdash;

But oftentimes, among my mind,

A Glee possesseth me,

That had I Ballet knowledge&mdash; Would put itself abroad

In Pirouette to blanch a Troupe&mdash; Or lay a Prima, mad,

And though I had no Gown of Gauze&mdash; No Ringlet, to my Hair,

Nor hopped to Audiences&mdash;like Birds, One Claw upon the Air,

Nor tossed my shape in Eider Balls,

Nor rolled on wheels of snow

Till I was out of sight, in sound,

The House encore me so&mdash;

Nor any know I know the Art

I mention&mdash;easy&mdash;Here&mdash; Nor any Placard boast me&mdash;

It's full as Opera&mdash;

Saints, with ravished slate and pencil Solve our April Day!

Sweeter than a vanished frolic

From a vanished green!

Swifter than the hoofs of Horsemen

Modest, let us walk among it

With our faces veiled&mdash;

As they say polite Archangels

Do in meeting God!

Not for me&mdash;to prate about it!

Not for you&mdash;to say

"Charming April Day"!

By which Children slow

To sublimer Recitation

I cautious, scanned my little life


I cautious, scanned my little life&mdash; I winnowed what would fade

From what would last till Heads like mine Should be a-dreaming laid.

I put the latter in a Barn&mdash;

The former, blew away.

I went one winter morning

And lo - my priceless Hay

Was not upon the "Scaffold"&mdash; Was not upon the "Beam"&mdash; And from a thriving Farmer&mdash;

A Cynic, I became.

Whether a Thief did it&mdash;

Whether it was the wind&mdash;

Whether Deity's guiltless&mdash;

My business is, to find!

So I begin to ransack!

How is it Hearts, with Thee?

Art thou within the little Barn

Love provided Thee?

I could suffice for Him, I knew&mdash; He&mdash;could suffice for Me&mdash; Yet Hesitating Fractions&mdash;Both Surveyed Infinity&mdash;

"Would I be Whole" He sudden broached&mdash; My syllable rebelled&mdash;

'Twas face to face with Nature&mdash;forced&mdash;

'Twas face to face with God&mdash; Withdrew the Sun&mdash;to Other Wests&mdash; Withdrew the furthest Star

Before Decision&mdash;stooped to speech&mdash; And then&mdash;be audibler

The Answer of the Sea unto

The Motion of the Moon&mdash;

Herself adjust Her Tides&mdash;unto&mdash; Could I&mdash;do else&mdash;with Mine?

I cried at Pity&mdash;not at Pain


I cried at Pity&mdash;not at Pain&mdash; I heard a Woman say

"Poor Child"&mdash;and something in her voice Convicted me&mdash;of me&mdash; So long I fainted, to myself

It seemed the common way,

And Health, and Laughter, Curious things&mdash; To look at, like a Toy&mdash;

To sometimes hear "Rich people" buy And see the Parcel rolled&mdash;

And carried, I supposed&mdash;to Heaven, For children, made of Gold&mdash;

But not to touch, or wish for,

Or think of, with a sigh&mdash;

And so and so&mdash;had been to me, Had God willed differently.

I wish I knew that Woman's name&mdash; So when she comes this way,

To hold my life, and hold my ears

For fear I hear her say

She's "sorry I am dead"&mdash;again&mdash; Just when the Grave and I&mdash;

Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep, Our only Lullaby&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





I cried at Pity—not at Pain


I cried at Pity—not at Pain—

I heard a Woman say

"Poor Child"—and something in her voice Convicted me—of me—

So long I fainted, to myself

It seemed the common way,

And Health, and Laughter, Curious things—

To look at, like a Toy—

To sometimes hear "Rich people" buy And see the Parcel rolled—

And carried, I supposed—to Heaven,

For children, made of Gold—

But not to touch, or wish for,

Or think of, with a sigh—

And so and so—had been to me,

Had God willed differently.

I wish I knew that Woman's name—

So when she comes this way,

To hold my life, and hold my ears

For fear I hear her say

She's "sorry I am dead"—again—

Just when the Grave and I—

I cross till I am weary


I cross till I am weary

A Mountain&mdash;in my mind&mdash; More Mountains&mdash;then a Sea&mdash; More Seas&mdash;And then

A Desert&mdash;find&mdash;

And My Horizon blocks

With steady&mdash;drifting&mdash;Grains Of unconjectured quantity&mdash;

As Asiatic Rains&mdash;

Nor this&mdash;defeat my Pace&mdash; It hinder from the West

But as an Enemy's Salute

One hurrying to Rest&mdash;

What merit had the Goal&mdash;

Except there intervene

Faint Doubt&mdash;and far Competitor&mdash; To jeopardize the Gain?

At last&mdash;the Grace in sight&mdash; I shout unto my feet&mdash;

I offer them the Whole of Heaven

The instant that we meet&mdash;

They strive&mdash;and yet delay&mdash; They perish&mdash;Do we die&mdash; Or is this Death's Experiment&mdash; Reversed&mdash;in Victory?

Emily Dickinson





I Died For Beauty

I died for beauty, but was scarce

Adjusted in the tomb,

When one who died for truth was lain

In an adjoining room.

He questioned softly why I failed?

"For beauty," I replied.

"And I for truth - the two are one; We brethren are," he said.

And so, as kinsmen met a-night,

We talked between the rooms,

Until the moss had reached our lips,

And covered up our names.

Emily Dickinson

I dreaded that first Robin, so


I dreaded that first Robin, so,

But He is mastered, now,

I'm accustomed to Him grown,

He hurts a little, though&mdash;

I thought If I could only live

Till that first Shout got by&mdash; Not all Pianos in the Woods

Had power to mangle me&mdash;

I dared not meet the Daffodils&mdash; For fear their Yellow Gown

Would pierce me with a fashion

So foreign to my own&mdash;

I wished the Grass would hurry&mdash; So&mdash;when 'twas time to see&mdash; He'd be too tall, the tallest one

Could stretch&mdash;to look at me&mdash; I could not bear the Bees should come, I wished they'd stay away

In those dim countries where they go,

What word had they, for me?

They're here, though; not a creature failed&mdash; No Blossom stayed away

In gentle deference to me&mdash;

The Queen of Calvary&mdash;

Each one salutes me, as he goes,

And I, my childish Plumes,

Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment

Of their unthinking Drums&mdash;

I dwell in Possibility


I dwell in Possibility&mdash;

A fairer House than Prose&mdash;

More numerous of Windows&mdash;

Superior&mdash;for Doors&mdash; Of Chambers as the Cedars&mdash;

Impregnable of Eye&mdash;

And for an Everlasting Roof

The Gambrels of the Sky&mdash;

Of Visitors&mdash;the fairest&mdash; For Occupation&mdash;This&mdash; The spreading wide of narrow Hands

To gather Paradise&mdash;

I envy Seas, whereon He rides


I envy Seas, whereon He rides&mdash; I envy Spokes of Wheels

Of Chariots, that Him convey&mdash; I envy Crooked Hills

That gaze upon His journey&mdash;

How easy All can see

What is forbidden utterly

As Heaven&mdash;unto me!

I envy Nests of Sparrows&mdash;

That dot His distant Eaves&mdash;

The wealthy Fly, upon His Pane&mdash; The happy&mdash;happy Leaves&mdash; That just abroad His Window

Have Summer's leave to play&mdash; The Ear Rings of Pizarro

Could not obtain for me&mdash;

I envy Light&mdash;that wakes Him&mdash; And Bells&mdash;that boldly ring

To tell Him it is Noon, abroad&mdash; Myself&mdash;be Noon to Him&mdash; Yet interdict&mdash;my Blossom&mdash; And abrogate&mdash;my Bee&mdash; Lest Noon in Everlasting Night&mdash; Drop Gabriel&mdash;and Me&mdash; Emily Dickinson





I fear a Man of frugal Speech

Emily Dickinson





I felt a cleaving in my mind

I felt a cleaving in my mind

As if my brain had split;

I tried to match it, seam by seam,

But could not make them fit.

The thought behind I strove to join

Unto the thought before,

But sequence ravelled out of reach

Like balls upon a floor.

Emily Dickinson





I felt a funeral in my brain,

I felt a funeral in my brain,

And mourners, to and fro,

Kept treading, treading, till it seemed That sense was breaking through.

And when they all were seated,

A service like a drum

Kept beating, beating, till I thought

My mind was going numb

And then I heard them lift a box,

And creak across my soul

With those same boots of lead, again.

Then space began to toll

As all the heavens were a bell,

And being, but an ear,

And I and Silence some strange Race

Wrecked, solitary, here.

Emily Dickinson





I felt a Funeral, in my Brain

I felt my life with both my hands


I felt my life with both my hands

To see if it was there&mdash;

I held my spirit to the Glass,

To prove it possibler&mdash;

I turned my Being round and round

And paused at every pound

To ask the Owner's name&mdash;

For doubt, that I should know the Sound&mdash; I judged my features&mdash;jarred my hair&mdash; I pushed my dimples by, and waited&mdash; If they&mdash;twinkled back&mdash; Conviction might, of me&mdash;

I told myself, "Take Courage, Friend&mdash; That&mdash;was a former time&mdash; But we might learn to like the Heaven, As well as our Old Home!"

Emily Dickinson





I found the phrase to every thought

I found the phrase to every thought

I ever had, but one;

And that defies me,--as a hand

Did try to chalk the sun

To races nurtured in the dark;--

How would your own begin?

Can blaze be done in cochineal,

Or noon in mazarin?

Emily Dickinson

I gained it so


I gained it so&mdash;

By Climbing slow&mdash;

By Catching at the Twigs that grow

Between the Bliss&mdash;and me&mdash; It hung so high

As well the Sky

Attempt by Strategy&mdash;

I said I gained it&mdash;

This&mdash;was all&mdash;

Look, how I clutch it

Lest it fall&mdash;

And I a Pauper go&mdash;

Unfitted by an instant's Grace

For the Contented&mdash;Beggar's face I wore&mdash;an hour ago&mdash; Emily Dickinson





I gave myself to Him


I gave myself to Him&mdash;

And took Himself, for Pay,

The solemn contract of a Life

Was ratified, this way&mdash;

The Wealth might disappoint&mdash; Myself a poorer prove

Than this great Purchaser suspect,

The Daily Own&mdash;of Love

Depreciate the Vision&mdash;

But till the Merchant buy&mdash;

Still Fable&mdash;in the Isles of Spice&mdash; The subtle Cargoes&mdash;lie&mdash; At least&mdash;'tis Mutual&mdash;Risk&mdash; Some&mdash;found it&mdash;Mutual Gain&mdash; Sweet Debt of Life&mdash;Each Night to owe&mdash; Insolvent&mdash;every Noon&mdash; Emily Dickinson





I got so I could take his name


I got so I could take his name&mdash; Without&mdash;Tremendous gain&mdash; That Stop-sensation&mdash;on my Soul&mdash; And Thunder&mdash;in the Room&mdash; I got so I could walk across

That Angle in the floor,

Where he turned so, and I turned&mdash;how&mdash; And all our Sinew tore&mdash;

I got so I could stir the Box&mdash; In which his letters grew

Without that forcing, in my breath&mdash; As Staples&mdash;driven through&mdash; Could dimly recollect a Grace&mdash; I think, they call it "God"&mdash; Renowned to ease Extremity&mdash;

When Formula, had failed&mdash;

And shape my Hands&mdash;

Petition's way,

Tho' ignorant of a word

That Ordination&mdash;utters&mdash; My Business, with the Cloud,

If any Power behind it, be,

Not subject to Despair&mdash;

It care, in some remoter way,

For so minute affair

As Misery&mdash;

Itself, too vast, for interrupting&mdash;more&mdash; Emily Dickinson





I had a guinea golden


I had a guinea golden&mdash;

I lost it in the sand&mdash;

And tho' the sum was simple

And pounds were in the land&mdash; Still, had it such a value

Unto my frugal eye&mdash;

That when I could not find it&mdash; I sat me down to sigh.

I had a crimson Robin&mdash;

Who sang full many a day

But when the woods were painted,

He, too, did fly away&mdash;

Time brought me other Robins&mdash; Their ballads were the same&mdash; Still, for my missing Troubador

I kept the "house at hame."

I had a star in heaven&mdash;

One "Pleiad" was its name&mdash; And when I was not heeding,

It wandered from the same.

And tho' the skies are crowded&mdash; And all the night ashine&mdash;

I do not care about it&mdash;

Since none of them are mine.

My story has a moral&mdash;

I have a missing friend&mdash;

"Pleiad" its name, and Robin, And guinea in the sand.

And when this mournful ditty

Accompanied with tear&mdash;

Shall meet the eye of traitor

In country far from here&mdash;

Grant that repentance solemn

May seize upon his mind&mdash;

And he no consolation

Beneath the sun may find.

Emily Dickinson





I had been hungry all the years-

I had been hungry all the years-

My noon had come, to dine-

I, trembling, drew the table near

And touched the curious wine.

'T was this on tables I had seen

When turning, hungry, lone,

I looked in windows, for the wealth

I could not hope to own.

I did not know the ample bread,

'T was so unlike the crumb

The birds and I had often shared

In Nature's dining-room.

The plenty hurt me, 't was so new,--

Myself felt ill and odd,

As berry of a mountain bush

Transplanted to the road.

Nor was I hungry; so I found

That hunger was a way

Of persons outside windows,

The entering takes away.

Emily Dickinson





I had been hungry, all the Years


I had been hungry, all the Years&mdash; My Noon had Come&mdash;to dine&mdash; I trembling drew the Table near&mdash; And touched the Curious Wine&mdash;

I had no Cause to be awake


I had no Cause to be awake&mdash;

My Best&mdash;was gone to sleep&mdash; And Morn a new politeness took&mdash; And failed to wake them up&mdash;

But called the others&mdash;clear&mdash; And passed their Curtains by&mdash; Sweet Morning&mdash;when I oversleep&mdash; Knock&mdash;Recollect&mdash;to Me&mdash; I looked at Sunrise&mdash;Once&mdash; And then I looked at Them&mdash;

And wishfulness in me arose&mdash; For Circumstance the same&mdash;

'Twas such an Ample Peace&mdash;

It could not hold a Sigh&mdash;

'Twas Sabbath&mdash;with the Bells divorced&mdash;

'Twas Sunset&mdash;all the Day&mdash; So choosing but a Gown&mdash;

And taking but a Prayer&mdash;

The only Raiment I should need&mdash; I struggled&mdash;and was There&mdash; Emily Dickinson





I had no time to Hate


I had no time to Hate&mdash;

Because

The Grave would hinder Me&mdash;

And Life was not so

Ample I

Could finish&mdash;Enmity&mdash; Nor had I time to Love&mdash;

But since

Some Industry must be&mdash;

The little Toil of Love&mdash;

I thought

Be large enough for Me&mdash;

I had not minded&mdash;Walls


I had not minded&mdash;Walls&mdash; Were Universe&mdash;one Rock&mdash; And fr I heard his silver Call

The other side the Block&mdash;

I'd tunnel&mdash;till my Groove

Pushed sudden thro' to his&mdash;

Then my face take her Recompense&mdash; The looking in his Eyes&mdash;

But 'tis a single Hair&mdash;

A filament&mdash;a law&mdash;

A Cobweb&mdash;wove in Adamant&mdash; A Battlement&mdash;of Straw&mdash; A limit like the Veil

Unto the Lady's face&mdash;

But every Mesh&mdash;a Citadel&mdash; And Dragons&mdash;in the Crease&mdash; Emily Dickinson

Emily Dickinson





I had some things that I called mine


I had some things that I called mine&mdash; And God, that he called his,

Till, recently a rival Claim

Disturbed these amities.

The property, my garden,

Which having sown with care,

He claims the pretty acre,

And sends a Bailiff there.

The station of the parties

Forbids publicity,

But Justice is sublimer

Than arms, or pedigree.

I'll institute an "Action"&mdash; I'll vindicate the law&mdash;

Jove! Choose your counsel&mdash;

I retain "Shaw"!

Emily Dickinson






I had the Glory&mdash;that will do&mdash; An Honor, Thought can turn her to

When lesser Fames invite&mdash;

With one long "Nay"&mdash; Bliss' early shape

Deforming&mdash;Dwindling&mdash;Gulfing up&mdash; Time's possibility.

I have a Bird in spring


I have a Bird in spring

Which for myself doth sing&mdash;

The spring decoys.

And as the summer nears&mdash;

And as the Rose appears,

Robin is gone.

Yet do I not repine

Knowing that Bird of mine

Though flown&mdash;

Learneth beyond the sea

Melody new for me

And will return.

Fast is a safer hand

Held in a truer Land

Are mine&mdash;

And though they now depart,

Tell I my doubting heart

They're thine.

In a serener Bright,

In a more golden light

I see

Each little doubt and fear,

Each little discord here

Removed.

Then will I not repine,

Knowing that Bird of mine

Though flown

Shall in a distant tree

Bright melody for me

Return.

Emily Dickinson





I have a King, who does not speak


I have a King, who does not speak&mdash; So&mdash;wondering&mdash;thro' the hours meek I trudge the day away&mdash;

Half glad when it is night, and sleep, If, haply, thro' a dream, to peep

In parlors, shut by day.

And if I do&mdash;when morning comes&mdash; It is as if a hundred drums

Did round my pillow roll,

And shouts fill all my Childish sky,

And Bells keep saying "Victory"

From steeples in my soul!

And if I don't&mdash;the little Bird Within the Orchard, is not heard,

And I omit to pray

"Father, thy will be done" today For my will goes the other way,

And it were perjury!

Emily Dickinson





I have never seen


I have never seen "Volcanoes"—

But, when Travellers tell

How those old—phlegmatic mountains

Usually so still—

Bear within—appalling Ordnance,

Fire, and smoke, and gun,

Taking Villages for breakfast,

And appalling Men—

If the stillness is Volcanic

In the human face

When upon a pain Titanic

Features keep their place—

If at length the smouldering anguish

Will not overcome—

And the palpitating Vineyard

In the dust, be thrown?

If some loving Antiquary,

On Resumption Morn,

Will not cry with joy "Pompeii"!

To the Hills return!

I haven't told my garden yet


I haven't told my garden yet&mdash; Lest that should conquer me.

I haven't quite the strength now

To break it to the Bee&mdash;

I will not name it in the street

For shops would stare at me&mdash; That one so shy&mdash;so ignorant

Should have the face to die.

The hillsides must not know it&mdash; Where I have rambled so&mdash;

Nor tell the loving forests

The day that I shall go&mdash;

Nor lisp it at the table&mdash;

Nor heedless by the way

Hint that within the Riddle

One will walk today&mdash;

I heard a Fly buzz -- when I died --

I heard a Fly buzz -- when I died --

The Stillness in the Room

Was like the Stillness in the Air --

Between the Heaves of Storm --

The Eyes around -- had wrung them dry --

And Breaths were gathering firm

For that last Onset -- when the King

Be witnessed -- in the Room --

I willed my Keepsakes -- signed away

What portion of me be

Assignable -- and then it was

There interposed a Fly --

With Blue -- uncertain stumbling Buzz --

Between the light -- and me --

And then the Windows failed -- and then I could not see to see --

Be witnessed in his power.

I held a Jewel in my fingers


I held a Jewel in my fingers&mdash; And went to sleep&mdash;

The day was warm, and winds were prosy&mdash; I said "'Twill keep"&mdash; I woke&mdash;and chid my honest fingers, The Gem was gone&mdash;

And now, an Amethyst remembrance

Is all I own&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





I hide myself within my flower


I hide myself within my flower,

That fading from your Vase,

You, unsuspecting, feel for me&mdash; Almost a loneliness.

Emily Dickinson





I keep my pledge


I keep my pledge.

I was not called&mdash;

Death did not notice me.

I bring my Rose.

I plight again,

By every sainted Bee&mdash;

By Daisy called from hillside&mdash; by Bobolink from lane.

Blossom and I&mdash;

Her oath, and mine&mdash;

Will surely come again.

Emily Dickinson





I know a place where summer strives

I know a place where summer strives

With such a practised frost,

She each year leads her daisies back,

Recording briefly, 'Lost.'

But when the south wind stirs the pools And struggles in the lanes,

Her heart misgives her for her vow,

And she pours soft refrains

Into the lap of adamant,

And spices, and the dew,

That stiffens quietly to quartz

Upon her amber shoe.

Emily Dickinson





I know lives, I could miss


I know lives, I could miss

Without a Misery&mdash;

Others&mdash;whose instant's wanting&mdash; Would be Eternity&mdash;

The last&mdash;a scanty Number&mdash;

'Twould scarcely fill a Two&mdash; The first&mdash;a Gnat's Horizon

Could easily outgrow&mdash;

Emily Dickinson






I know some lonely Houses off the Road A Robber'd like the look of&mdash; Wooden barred,

And Windows hanging low,

Inviting to&mdash;

A Portico,

Where two could creep&mdash;

One&mdash;hand the Tools&mdash; The other peep&mdash;

To make sure All's Asleep&mdash;

Old fashioned eyes&mdash;

Not easy to surprise!

How orderly the Kitchen'd look, by night, With just a Clock&mdash;

But they could gag the Tick&mdash; And Mice won't bark&mdash;

And so the Walls&mdash;don't tell&mdash; None&mdash;will&mdash;

A pair of Spectacles ajar just stir&mdash; An Almanac's aware&mdash;

Was it the Mat&mdash;winked,

Or a Nervous Star?

The Moon&mdash;slides down the stair, To see who's there!

There's plunder&mdash;where&mdash; Tankard, or Spoon&mdash;

Earring&mdash;or Stone&mdash;

A Watch&mdash;Some Ancient Brooch

To match the Grandmama&mdash;

Staid sleeping&mdash;there&mdash; Day&mdash;rattles&mdash;too

Stealth's&mdash;slow&mdash;

The Sun has got as far

As the third Sycamore&mdash;

Screams Chanticleer

"Who's there"?

And Echoes&mdash;Trains away,

Sneer&mdash;"Where"!

While the old Couple, just astir,

Fancy the Sunrise&mdash;left the door ajar!

I know that He exists


I know that He exists.

Somewhere&mdash;in Silence&mdash; He has hid his rare life

From our gross eyes.

'Tis an instant's play.

'Tis a fond Ambush&mdash;

Just to make Bliss

Earn her own surprise!

But&mdash;should the play

Prove piercing earnest&mdash;

Should the glee&mdash;glaze&mdash; In Death's&mdash;stiff&mdash;stare&mdash; Would not the fun

Look too expensive!

Would not the jest&mdash;

Have crawled too far!

I know where Wells grow&mdash;Droughtless Wells&mdash; Deep dug&mdash;for Summer days&mdash; Where Mosses go no more away&mdash; And Pebble&mdash;safely plays&mdash; It's made of Fathoms&mdash;and a Belt&mdash; A Belt of jagged Stone&mdash;

Inlaid with Emerald&mdash;half way down&mdash; And Diamonds&mdash;jumbled on&mdash; It has no Bucket&mdash;Were I rich A Bucket I would buy&mdash;

I'm often thirsty&mdash;but my lips Are so high up&mdash;You see&mdash; I read in an Old fashioned Book

That People "thirst no more"&mdash; The Wells have Buckets to them there&mdash; It must mean that&mdash;I'm sure&mdash; Shall We remember Parching&mdash;then?

Those Waters sound so grand&mdash; I think a little Well&mdash;like Mine&mdash; Dearer to understand&mdash;

I know where Wells grow—Droughtless Wells—

Deep dug—for Summer days—

Where Mosses go no more away—

And Pebble—safely plays—

It's made of Fathoms—and a Belt—

A Belt of jagged Stone—

Inlaid with Emerald—half way down—

And Diamonds—jumbled on—

It has no Bucket—Were I rich

A Bucket I would buy—

I'm often thirsty—but my lips

Are so high up—You see—

I read in an Old fashioned Book

That People "thirst no more"—

The Wells have Buckets to them there—

It must mean that—I'm sure—

Shall We remember Parching—then?

Those Waters sound so grand—

I think a little Well—like Mine—

Dearer to understand—

I learned&mdash;at least&mdash;what Home could be&mdash; How ignorant I had been

Of pretty ways of Covenant&mdash;

How awkward at the Hymn

Round our new Fireside&mdash;but for this&mdash; This pattern&mdash;of the Way&mdash; Whose Memory drowns me, like the Dip

Of a Celestial Sea&mdash;

What Mornings in our Garden&mdash;guessed&mdash; What Bees&mdash;for us&mdash;to hum&mdash; With only Birds to interrupt

The Ripple of our Theme&mdash;

And Task for Both&mdash;

When Play be done&mdash;

Your Problem&mdash;of the Brain&mdash; And mine&mdash;some foolisher effect&mdash; A Ruffle&mdash;or a Tune&mdash; The Afternoons&mdash;Together spent&mdash; And Twilight&mdash;in the Lanes&mdash; Some ministry to poorer lives&mdash; Seen poorest&mdash;thro' our gains&mdash; And then Return&mdash;and Night&mdash;and Home&mdash; And then away to You to pass&mdash; A new&mdash;diviner&mdash;care&mdash; Till Sunrise take us back to Scene&mdash; Transmuted&mdash;Vivider&mdash; This seems a Home&mdash;

I like a look of Agony


I like a look of Agony,

Because I know it's true&mdash;

Men do not sham Convulsion,

Nor simulate, a Throe&mdash;

The Eyes glaze once&mdash;and that is Death&mdash; Impossible to feign

The Beads upon the Forehead

By homely Anguish strung.

Emily Dickinson





I like to see it lap the Miles


I like to see it lap the Miles&mdash; And lick the Valleys up&mdash;

And stop to feed itself at Tanks&mdash; And then&mdash;prodigious step

Around a Pile of Mountains&mdash;

And supercilious peer

In Shanties&mdash;by the sides of Roads&mdash; And then a Quarry pare

To fit its Ribs

And crawl between

Complaining all the while

In horrid&mdash;hooting stanza&mdash; Then chase itself down Hill&mdash; And neigh like Boanerges&mdash;

Then&mdash;punctual as a Star

Stop&mdash;docile and omnipotent

At its own stable door&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





I like to see it lap the miles,

I like to see it lap the miles,

And lick the valleys up,

And stop to feed itself at tanks;

And then, prodigious, step

Around a pile of mountains,

And, supercilious, peer

In shanties by the sides of roads;

And then a quarry pare

To fit its sides, and crawl between,

Complaining all the while

In horrid, hooting stanza;

Then chase itself down hill

And neigh like Boanerges;

Then, punctual as a star,

Stop--docile and omnipotent--

At its own stable door.

I live with Him&mdash;I see His face&mdash; I go no more away

I lived on Dread


I lived on Dread&mdash;

To Those who know

The Stimulus there is

In Danger&mdash;Other impetus

Is numb&mdash;and Vitalless&mdash; As 'twere a Spur&mdash;upon the Soul&mdash; A Fear will urge it where

To go without the Sceptre's aid

Were Challenging Despair.

Emily Dickinson





I lived on dread; to those who know

I lived on dread; to those who know

The stimulus there is

In danger, other impetus

Is numb and vital-less.

As't were a spur upon the soul,

A fear will urge it where

To go without the spectre's aid

Were challenging despair.

Emily Dickinson





I lost a World - the other day!


I lost a World - the other day!

Has Anybody found?

You'll know it by the Row of Stars

Around its forehead bound.

A Rich man&mdash;might not notice it&mdash; Yet&mdash;to my frugal Eye,

Of more Esteem than Ducats&mdash;

Oh find it&mdash;Sir&mdash;for me!

Emily Dickinson





I made slow Riches but my Gain


I made slow Riches but my Gain

Was steady as the Sun

And every Night, it numbered more

Than the preceding One

All Days, I did not earn the same

But my perceiveless Gain

Inferred the less by Growing than

The Sum that it had grown.

Emily Dickinson





I make His Crescent fill or lack


I make His Crescent fill or lack&mdash; His Nature is at Full

Or Quarter&mdash;as I signify&mdash; His Tides&mdash;do I control&mdash; He holds superior in the Sky

Or gropes, at my Command

Behind inferior Clouds&mdash;or round A Mist's slow Colonnade&mdash;

But since We hold a Mutual Disc&mdash; And front a Mutual Day&mdash;

Which is the Despot, neither knows&mdash; Nor Whose&mdash;the Tyranny&mdash; Emily Dickinson





I many times thought Peace had come


I many times thought Peace had come

When Peace was far away&mdash;

As Wrecked Men&mdash;deem they sight the Land&mdash; At Centre of the Sea&mdash;

And struggle slacker&mdash;but to prove As hopelessly as I&mdash;

How many the fictitious Shores&mdash; Before the Harbor be&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





I meant to find Her when I came


I meant to find Her when I came&mdash; Death&mdash;had the same design&mdash; But the Success&mdash;was His&mdash;it seems&mdash; And the Surrender&mdash;Mine&mdash; I meant to tell Her how I longed

For just this single time&mdash;

But Death had told Her so the first&mdash; And she had past, with Him&mdash;

To wander&mdash;now&mdash;is my Repose&mdash; To rest&mdash;To rest would be

A privilege of Hurricane

To Memory&mdash;and Me.

Emily Dickinson





I meant to have but modest needs


I meant to have but modest needs&mdash; Such as Content&mdash;and Heaven&mdash; Within my income&mdash;these could lie And Life and I&mdash;keep even&mdash; But since the last&mdash;included both&mdash; It would suffice my Prayer

But just for One&mdash;to stipulate&mdash; And Grace would grant the Pair&mdash; And so&mdash;upon this wise&mdash;I prayed&mdash; Great Spirit&mdash;Give to me

A Heaven not so large as Yours,

But large enough&mdash;for me&mdash; A Smile suffused Jehovah's face&mdash; The Cherubim&mdash;withdrew&mdash; Grave Saints stole out to look at me&mdash; And showed their dimples&mdash;too&mdash; I left the Place, with all my might&mdash; I threw my Prayer away&mdash;

The Quiet Ages picked it up&mdash; And Judgment&mdash;twinkled&mdash;too&mdash; Tat one so honest&mdash;be extant&mdash; It take the Tale for true&mdash;

That "Whatsoever Ye shall ask&mdash; Itself be given You"&mdash;

But I, grown shrewder&mdash;scan the Skies With a suspicious Air&mdash;

I measure every grief I meet

I measure every grief I meet

With analytic eyes;

I wonder if it weighs like mine,

Or has an easier size.

I wonder if they bore it long,

Or did it just begin?

I could not tell the date of mine,

It feels so old a pain.

I wonder if it hurts to live,

And if they have to try,

And whether, could they choose between, They would not rather die.

I wonder if when years have piled--

Some thousands--on the cause

Of early hurt, if such a lapse

Could give them any pause;

Or would they go on aching still

Through centuries above,

Enlightened to a larger pain

By contrast with the love.

The grieved are many, I am told;

The reason deeper lies,--

Death is but one and comes but once

And only nails the eyes.

There's grief of want, and grief of cold,--

A sort they call 'despair,'

There's banishment from native eyes,

In sight of native air.

And though I may not guess the kind

Correctly yet to me

A piercing comfort it affords

In passing Calvary,

To note the fashions of the cross

Of those that stand alone

Still fascinated to presume

That some are like my own.

Emily Dickinson






I measure every Grief I meet

With narrow, probing, Eyes--

I wonder if It weighs like Mine--

Or has an Easier size.

I could not tell the Date of Mine--

It feels so old a pain--

I wonder if it hurts to live--

And if They have to try--

And whether--could They choose between--

It would not be--to die--

I note that Some--gone patient long--

At length, renew their smile--

An imitation of a Light

That has so little Oil--

I wonder if when Years have piled--

Some Thousands--on the Harm--

That hurt them early--such a lapse

Could give them any Balm--

Or would they go on aching still

Through Centuries of Nerve--

Enlightened to a larger Pain--

In Contrast with the Love--

The Grieved--are many--I am told--

There is the various Cause--

Death--is but one--and comes but once--

And only nails the eyes--

I ment to find her when I came;

I meant to find her when I came;

Death had the same design;

But the success was his, it seems,

And the discomfit mine.

I meant to tell her how I longed

For just this single time;

But Death had told her so the first,

And she had hearkened him.

To wander now is my abode;

To rest,--to rest would be

A privilege of hurricane

To memory and me.

Emily Dickinson





I met a King this afternoon!


I met a King this afternoon!

He had not on a Crown indeed,

A little Palmleaf Hat was all,

And he was barefoot, I'm afraid!

But sure I am he Ermine wore

Beneath his faded Jacket's blue&mdash; And sure I am, the crest he bore

Within that Jacket's pocket too!

For 'twas too stately for an Earl&mdash; A Marquis would not go so grand!

'Twas possibly a Czar petite&mdash; A Pope, or something of that kind!

If I must tell you, of a Horse

My freckled Monarch held the rein&mdash; Doubtless an estimable Beast,

But not at all disposed to run!

And such a wagon! While I live

Dare I presume to see

Another such a vehicle

As then transported me!

Two other ragged Princes

His royal state partook!

Doubtless the first excursion

These sovereigns ever took!

I question if the Royal Coach

Round which the Footmen wait

Has the significance, on high,

Of this Barefoot Estate!

Emily Dickinson





I never felt at Home&mdash;Below


I never felt at Home&mdash;Below&mdash;-

And in the Handsome Skies

I shall not feel at Home&mdash;I know&mdash; I don't like Paradise&mdash;

Because it's Sunday&mdash;all the time&mdash; And Recess&mdash;never comes&mdash; And Eden'll be so lonesome

Bright Wednesday Afternoons&mdash; If God could make a visit&mdash;

Or ever took a Nap&mdash;

So not to see us&mdash;but they say Himself&mdash;a Telescope

Perennial beholds us&mdash;

Myself would run away

From Him&mdash;and Holy Ghost&mdash;and All&mdash; But there's the "Judgement Day"!

Emily Dickinson

I never hear the word

I never hear the word "escape"

Without a quicker blood,

A sudden expectation,

A flying attitude.

I never hear of prisons broad

By soldiers battered down,

But I tug childish at my bars, --

Only to fail again!

I never lost as much but twice


I never lost as much but twice,

And that was in the sod.

Twice have I stood a beggar

Before the door of God!

Angels&mdash;twice descending

Reimbursed my store&mdash;

Burglar! Banker&mdash;Father!

I am poor once more!

Emily Dickinson





I Never Saw a Moor

I never saw a moor;

I never saw the sea,

Yet know I how the heather looks

And what a billow be.

I never spoke with God,

Nor visited in heaven.

Yet certain am I of the spot

As if the checks were given.

Emily Dickinson





I never saw a moor,

As if the chart were given.

I never told the buried gold


I never told the buried gold

Upon the hill&mdash;that lies&mdash; I saw the sun&mdash;his plunder done Crouch low to guard his prize.

He stood as near

As stood you here&mdash;

A pace had been between&mdash;

Did but a snake bisect the brake

My life had forfeit been.

That was a wondrous booty&mdash;

I hope 'twas honest gained.

Those were the fairest ingots

That ever kissed the spade!

Whether to keep the secret&mdash;

Whether to reveal&mdash;

Whether as I ponder

Kidd will sudden sail&mdash;

Could a shrewd advise me

We might e'en divide&mdash;

Should a shrewd betray me&mdash;

Atropos decide!

Emily Dickinson





I often passed the village


I often passed the village

When going home from school&mdash; And wondered what they did there&mdash; And why it was so still&mdash;

I did not know the year then&mdash; In which my call would come&mdash; Earlier, by the Dial,

Than the rest have gone.

It's stiller than the sundown.

It's cooler than the dawn&mdash;

The Daisies dare to come here&mdash; And birds can flutter down&mdash;

So when you are tired&mdash;

Or perplexed&mdash;or cold&mdash; Trust the loving promise

Underneath the mould,

Cry "it's I," "take Dollie,"

And I will enfold!

Emily Dickinson

I play at Riches&mdash;to appease


I play at Riches&mdash;to appease

The Clamoring for Gold&mdash;

It kept me from a Thief, I think,

For often, overbold

With Want, and Opportunity&mdash;

I could have done a Sin

And been Myself that easy Thing

An independent Man&mdash;

But often as my lot displays

Too hungry to be borne

I deem Myself what I would be&mdash; And novel Comforting

My Poverty and I derive&mdash;

We question if the Man&mdash;

Who own&mdash;Esteem the Opulence&mdash; As We&mdash;Who never Can&mdash; Should ever these exploring Hands

Chance Sovereign on a Mine&mdash;

Or in the long&mdash;uneven term

To win, become their turn&mdash;

How fitter they will be&mdash;for Want&mdash; Enlightening so well&mdash;

I know not which, Desire, or Grant&mdash; Be wholly beautiful&mdash;

I prayed, at first, a little Girl


I prayed, at first, a little Girl,

Because they told me to&mdash;

But stopped, when qualified to guess

How prayer would feel&mdash;to me&mdash; If I believed God looked around,

Each time my Childish eye

Fixed full, and steady, on his own

In Childish honesty&mdash;

And told him what I'd like, today,

And parts of his far plan

That baffled me&mdash;

The mingled side

Of his Divinity&mdash;

And often since, in Danger,

I count the force 'twould be

To have a God so strong as that

To hold my life for me

Till I could take the Balance

That tips so frequent, now,

It takes me all the while to poise&mdash; And then&mdash;it doesn't stay&mdash; Emily Dickinson





I read my sentence&mdash;steadily


I read my sentence&mdash;steadily&mdash; Reviewed it with my eyes,

To see that I made no mistake

In its extremest clause&mdash;

The Date, and manner, of the shame&mdash; And then the Pious Form

That "God have mercy" on the Soul The Jury voted Him&mdash;

I made my soul familiar&mdash;with her extremity&mdash; That at the last, it should not be a novel Agony&mdash; But she, and Death, acquainted&mdash; Meet tranquilly, as friends&mdash; Salute, and pass, without a Hint&mdash; And there, the Matter ends&mdash;

Somehow, it will be even&mdash;

I robbed the Woods


I robbed the Woods&mdash;

The trusting Woods.

The unsuspecting Trees

Brought out their Burs and mosses

My fantasy to please.

I scanned their trinkets curious&mdash;I grasped&mdash;I bore away&mdash; What will the solemn Hemlock&mdash; What will the Oak tree say?

I rose&mdash;because He sank

My Soul grew straight.

I cheered my fainting Prince&mdash; I sang firm&mdash;even&mdash;Chants&mdash; I helped his Film&mdash;with Hymn&mdash; And when the Dews drew off

That held his Forehead stiff&mdash; I met him&mdash;

Balm to Balm&mdash;

I told him Best&mdash;must pass

Through this low Arch of Flesh&mdash; No Casque so brave

It spurn the Grave&mdash;

I told him Worlds I knew

Where Emperors grew&mdash;

If we were true&mdash;

That scalds me now&mdash;that scalds me now!

Emily Dickinson





I shall know why—when Time is over


I shall know why—when Time is over—

And I have ceased to wonder why—

Christ will explain each separate anguish In the fair schoolroom of the sky—

He will tell me what "Peter" promised—

And I—for wonder at his woe—

I shall forget the drop of Anguish

That scalds me now—that scalds me now!

Emily Dickinson





I should have been too glad, I see


I should have been too glad, I see&mdash; Too lifted&mdash;for the scant degree Of Life's penurious Round&mdash;

My little Circuit would have shamed

This new Circumference&mdash;have blamed&mdash; The homelier time behind.

I should have been too saved&mdash;I see&mdash; Too rescued&mdash;Fear too dim to me That I could spell the Prayer

I knew so perfect&mdash;yesterday&mdash; That Scalding One&mdash;Sabachthani&mdash; Recited fluent&mdash;here&mdash; Earth would have been too much&mdash;I see&mdash; And Heaven&mdash;not enough for me&mdash; I should have had the Joy

Without the Fear&mdash;to justify&mdash; The Palm&mdash;without the Calvary&mdash; So Savior&mdash;Crucify&mdash; Defeat&mdash;whets Victory&mdash;they say&mdash; The Reefs&mdash;in old Gethsemane&mdash; Endear the Coast&mdash;beyond!

'Tis Beggars&mdash;Banquets&mdash;can define&mdash;

'Tis Parching&mdash;vitalizes Wine&mdash;

"Faith" bleats&mdash;to understand!

Emily Dickinson





I should not dare to leave my friend


I should not dare to leave my friend,

Because&mdash;because if he should die While I was gone&mdash;and I&mdash;too late&mdash; Should reach the Heart that wanted me&mdash; If I should disappoint the eyes

That hunted&mdash;hunted so&mdash;to see&mdash; And could not bear to shut until

They "noticed" me&mdash;they noticed me&mdash; If I should stab the patient faith

So sure I'd come&mdash;so sure I'd come&mdash; It listening&mdash;listening&mdash;went to sleep&mdash; Telling my tardy name&mdash;

My Heart would wish it broke before&mdash; Since breaking then&mdash;since breaking then&mdash; Were useless as next morning's sun&mdash; Where midnight frosts&mdash;had lain!

Emily Dickinson





I showed her Heights she never saw


I showed her Heights she never saw&mdash;

"Would'st Climb," I said?

She said&mdash;"Not so"&mdash;

"With me&mdash;" I said&mdash;With me?

I showed her Secrets&mdash;Morning's Nest&mdash; The Rope the Nights were put across&mdash; And now&mdash;"Would'st have me for a Guest?"

She could not find her Yes&mdash;

And then, I brake my life&mdash;And Lo, A Light, for her, did solemn glow,

The larger, as her face withdrew&mdash; And could she, further, "No"?

Emily Dickinson





I sing to use the Waiting


I sing to use the Waiting

My Bonnet but to tie

And shut the Door unto my House

No more to do have I

Till His best step approaching

We journey to the Day

And tell each other how We sung

To Keep the Dark away.

Emily Dickinson





I sometimes drop it, for a Quick


I sometimes drop it, for a Quick&mdash; The Thought to be alive&mdash;

Anonymous Delight to know&mdash;

And Madder&mdash;to conceive&mdash; Consoles a Woe so monstrous

That did it tear all Day,

Without an instant's Respite&mdash;

'Twould look too far&mdash;to Die&mdash; Emily Dickinson





I started Early - Took my Dog

I started Early - Took my Dog -

And visited the Sea -

The Mermaids in the Basement

Came out to look at me -

And Frigates - in the Upper Floor

Extended Hempen Hands -

Presuming Me to be a Mouse -

Aground - upon the Sands -

But no Man moved Me - till the Tide

Went past my simple Shoe -

And past my Apron - and my Belt

And past my Bodice - too -

And made as He would eat me up -

As wholly as a Dew

Upon a Dandelion's Sleeve -

And then - I started - too -

And He - He followed - close behind -

I felt His Silver Heel

Upon my Ankle - Then my Shoes

Would overflow with Pearl -

Until We met the Solid Town -

No One He seemed to know -

And bowing - with a Mighty look -

At me - The Sea withdrew -

Emily Dickinson

I stepped from plank to plank

I stepped from plank to plank

So slow and cautiously;

The stars about my head I felt,

About my feet the sea.

I knew not but the next

Would be my final inch,--

This gave me that precarious gait

Some call experience.

Emily Dickinson





I stole them from a Bee


I stole them from a Bee&mdash;

Because&mdash;Thee&mdash;

Sweet plea&mdash;

He pardoned me!

Emily Dickinson





I taste a liquor never brewed

I taste a liquor never brewed,

From tankards scooped in pearl;

Not all the vats upon the Rhine

Yield such an alcohol!

Inebriate of air am I,

And debauchee of dew,

Reeling, through endless summer days,

From inns of molten blue.

When the landlord turn the drunken bee Out of the foxglove's door,

When butterflies renounce their drams, I shall but drink the more!

Till seraphs swing their snowy hats,

And saints to windows run,

To see the little tippler

Leaning against the sun!

Emily Dickinson





I tend my flowers for thee


I tend my flowers for thee&mdash;

Bright Absentee!

My Fuchsia's Coral Seams

Rip&mdash;while the Sower&mdash;dreams&mdash; Geraniums&mdash;tint&mdash;and spot&mdash; Low Daisies&mdash;dot&mdash;

My Cactus&mdash;splits her Beard

To show her throat&mdash;

Carnations&mdash;tip their spice&mdash; And Bees&mdash;pick up&mdash;

A Hyacinth&mdash;I hid&mdash;

Puts out a Ruffled Head&mdash;

And odors fall

From flasks&mdash;so small&mdash; You marvel how they held&mdash;

Globe Roses&mdash;break their satin glake&mdash; Upon my Garden floor&mdash;

Yet&mdash;thou&mdash;not there&mdash; I had as lief they bore

No Crimson&mdash;more&mdash;

Thy flower&mdash;be gay&mdash; Her Lord&mdash;away!

It ill becometh me&mdash;

I'll dwell in Calyx&mdash;Gray&mdash; How modestly&mdash;alway&mdash; Thy Daisy&mdash;

Draped for thee!

Emily Dickinson





I think I was enchanted


I think I was enchanted

When first a sombre Girl&mdash;

I read that Foreign Lady&mdash;

The Dark&mdash;felt beautiful&mdash; And whether it was noon at night&mdash; Or only Heaven&mdash;at Noon&mdash; For very Lunacy of Light

I had not power to tell&mdash;

The Bees&mdash;became as Butterflies&mdash; The Butterflies&mdash;as Swans&mdash; Approached&mdash;and spurned the narrow Grass&mdash; And just the meanest Tunes

That Nature murmured to herself

To keep herself in Cheer&mdash;

I took for Giants&mdash;practising Titanic Opera&mdash;

The Days&mdash;to Mighty Metres stept&mdash; The Homeliest&mdash;adorned

As if unto a Jubilee

'Twere suddenly confirmed&mdash;

I could not have defined the change&mdash; Conversion of the Mind

Like Sanctifying in the Soul&mdash; Is witnessed&mdash;not explained&mdash;

'Twas a Divine Insanity&mdash;

The Danger to be Sane

Should I again experience&mdash;

'Tis Antidote to turn&mdash;

To Tomes of solid Witchcraft&mdash; Magicians be asleep&mdash;

But Magic&mdash;hath an Element

Like Deity&mdash;to keep&mdash; Emily Dickinson





I think just how my shape will rise


I think just how my shape will rise&mdash; When I shall be "forgiven"&mdash; Till Hair&mdash;and Eyes&mdash;and timid Head&mdash; Are out of sight&mdash;in Heaven&mdash; I think just how my lips will weigh&mdash; With shapeless&mdash;quivering&mdash;prayer&mdash; That you&mdash;so late&mdash;"Consider" me&mdash; The "Sparrow" of your Care&mdash; I mind me that of Anguish&mdash;sent&mdash; Some drifts were moved away&mdash; Before my simple bosom&mdash;broke&mdash; And why not this&mdash;if they?

And so I con that thing&mdash;"forgiven"&mdash; Until&mdash;delirious&mdash;borne&mdash; By my long bright&mdash;and longer&mdash;trust&mdash; I drop my Heart&mdash;unshriven!

Emily Dickinson





I think the Hemlock likes to stand


I think the Hemlock likes to stand

Upon a Marge of Snow&mdash;

It suits his own Austerity&mdash;

And satisfies an awe

That men, must slake in Wilderness&mdash; And in the Desert&mdash;cloy&mdash; An instinct for the Hoar, the Bald&mdash; Lapland's&mdash;necessity&mdash; The Hemlock's nature thrives&mdash;on cold&mdash; The Gnash of Northern winds

Is sweetest nutriment&mdash;to him&mdash; His best Norwegian Wines&mdash;

To satin Races&mdash;he is nought&mdash; But Children on the Don,

Beneath his Tabernacles, play,

And Dnieper Wrestlers, run.

Emily Dickinson





I think the longest Hour of all


I think the longest Hour of all

Is when the Cars have come&mdash;

And we are waiting for the Coach&mdash; It seems as though the Time

Indignant&mdash;that the Joy was come&mdash; Did block the Gilded Hands&mdash;

And would not let the Seconds by&mdash; But slowest instant&mdash;ends&mdash; The Pendulum begins to count&mdash; Like little Scholars&mdash;loud&mdash; The steps grow thicker&mdash;in the Hall&mdash; The Heart begins to crowd&mdash;

Then I&mdash;my timid service done&mdash; Tho' service 'twas, of Love&mdash; Take up my little Violin&mdash;

And further North&mdash;remove.

Emily Dickinson






I think to Live&mdash;may be a Bliss To those who dare to try&mdash;

Beyond my limit to conceive&mdash; My lip&mdash;to testify&mdash; I think the Heart I former wore

Could widen&mdash;till to me

The Other, like the little Bank

Appear&mdash;unto the Sea&mdash; I think the Days&mdash;could every one In Ordination stand&mdash;

And Majesty&mdash;be easier&mdash; Than an inferior kind&mdash;

No numb alarm&mdash;lest Difference come&mdash; No Goblin&mdash;on the Bloom&mdash; No start in Apprehension's Ear,

No Bankruptcy&mdash;no Doom&mdash; But Certainties of Sun&mdash;

Midsummer&mdash;in the Mind&mdash; A steadfast South&mdash;upon the Soul&mdash; Her Polar time&mdash;behind&mdash; The Vision&mdash;pondered long&mdash; So plausible becomes

That I esteem the fiction&mdash;real&mdash; The Real&mdash;fictitious seems&mdash; How bountiful the Dream&mdash;

What Plenty&mdash;it would be&mdash; Had all my Life but been Mistake

Just rectified&mdash;in Thee

I took my Power in my Hand


I took my Power in my Hand&mdash;

And went against the World&mdash;

'Twas not so much as David&mdash;had&mdash; But I&mdash;was twice as bold&mdash; I aimed by Pebble&mdash;but Myself Was all the one that fell&mdash;

Was it Goliath&mdash;was too large&mdash; Or was myself&mdash;too small?

Emily Dickinson





I tried to think a lonelier Thing


I tried to think a lonelier Thing

Than any I had seen&mdash;

Some Polar Expiation&mdash;An Omen in the Bone Of Death's tremendous nearness&mdash; I probed Retrieverless things

My Duplicate&mdash;to borrow&mdash; A Haggard Comfort springs

From the belief that Somewhere&mdash; Within the Clutch of Thought&mdash; There dwells one other Creature

Of Heavenly Love&mdash;forgot&mdash; I plucked at our Partition

As One should pry the Walls&mdash; Between Himself&mdash;and Horror's Twin&mdash; Within Opposing Cells&mdash;

I almost strove to clasp his Hand,

Such Luxury&mdash;it grew&mdash; That as Myself&mdash;could pity Him&mdash; Perhaps he&mdash;pitied me&mdash; Emily Dickinson





I want—it pleaded—All its life—

"I want"—it pleaded—All its life—

I want—was chief it said

When Skill entreated it—the last—

And when so newly dead—

I could not deem it late—to hear

That single—steadfast sigh—

The lips had placed as with a "Please"

Toward Eternity—

Emily Dickinson





I was the slightest in the House


I was the slightest in the House&mdash; I took the smallest Room&mdash;

At night, my little Lamp, and Book&mdash; And one Geranium&mdash;

So stationed I could catch the Mint

That never ceased to fall&mdash;

And just my Basket&mdash;

Let me think&mdash;I'm sure&mdash; That this was all&mdash;

I never spoke&mdash;unless addressed&mdash; And then, 'twas brief and low&mdash; I could not bear to live&mdash;aloud&mdash; The Racket shamed me so&mdash;

And if it had not been so far&mdash; And any one I knew

Were going&mdash;I had often thought How noteless&mdash;I could die&mdash; Emily Dickinson





I watched the Moon around the House


I watched the Moon around the House

Until upon a Pane&mdash;

She stopped&mdash;a Traveller's privilege&mdash;for Rest&mdash; And there upon

I gazed&mdash;as at a stranger&mdash; The Lady in the Town

Doth think no incivility

To lift her Glass&mdash;upon&mdash; But never Stranger justified

The Curiosity

Like Mine&mdash;for not a Foot&mdash;nor Hand&mdash; Nor Formula&mdash;had she&mdash; But like a Head&mdash;a Guillotine Slid carelessly away&mdash;

Did independent, Amber&mdash;

Sustain her in the sky&mdash;

Or like a Stemless Flower&mdash;

Upheld in rolling Air

By finer Gravitations&mdash;

Than bind Philosopher&mdash;

No Hunger&mdash;had she&mdash;nor an Inn&mdash; Her Toilette&mdash;to suffice&mdash; Nor Avocation&mdash;nor Concern

For little Mysteries

As harass us&mdash;like Life&mdash;and Death&mdash; And Afterwards&mdash;or Nay&mdash; But seemed engrossed to Absolute&mdash; With shining&mdash;and the Sky&mdash; The privilege to scrutinize

Was scarce upon my Eyes

When, with a Silver practise&mdash; She vaulted out of Gaze&mdash;

And next&mdash;I met her on a Cloud&mdash; Myself too far below

To follow her superior Road&mdash; Or its advantage&mdash;Blue&mdash; Emily Dickinson

I went to Heaven


I went to Heaven&mdash;

'Twas a small Town&mdash;

Lit&mdash;with a Ruby&mdash;

Lathed&mdash;with Down&mdash;

Stiller&mdash;than the fields

At the full Dew&mdash;

Beautiful&mdash;as Pictures&mdash; No Man drew.

People&mdash;like the Moth&mdash; Of Mechlin&mdash;frames&mdash; Duties&mdash;of Gossamer&mdash; And Eider&mdash;names&mdash;

Almost&mdash;contented&mdash;

I went to heaven,--

I went to heaven,--

'T was a small town,

Lit with a ruby,

Lathed with down.

Stiller than the fields

At the full dew,

Beautiful as pictures

No man drew.

People like the moth,

Of mechlin, frames,

Duties of gossamer,

And eider names.

Almost contented

I could be

'Mong such unique

Society.

I went to thank Her


I went to thank Her&mdash;

But She Slept&mdash;

Her Bed&mdash;a funneled Stone&mdash; With Nosegays at the Head and Foot&mdash; That Travellers&mdash;had thrown&mdash; Who went to thank Her&mdash;

But She Slept&mdash;

'Twas Short&mdash;to cross the Sea&mdash; To look upon Her like&mdash;alive&mdash; But turning back&mdash;'twas slow&mdash; Emily Dickinson





I would distil a cup


I would distil a cup,

And bear to all my friends,

Drinking to her no more astir,

By beck, or burn, or moor!

I would not paint&mdash;a picture


I would not paint&mdash;a picture&mdash; I'd rather be the One

Its bright impossibility

To dwell&mdash;delicious&mdash;on&mdash; And wonder how the fingers feel

Whose rare&mdash;celestial&mdash;stir&mdash; Evokes so sweet a Torment&mdash;

Such sumptuous&mdash;Despair&mdash; I would not talk, like Cornets&mdash; I'd rather be the One

Raised softly to the Ceilings&mdash; And out, and easy on&mdash;

Through Villages of Ether&mdash;

Myself endued Balloon

By but a lip of Metal&mdash;

The pier to my Pontoon&mdash;

Nor would I be a Poet&mdash;

It's finer&mdash;own the Ear&mdash; Enamored&mdash;impotent&mdash;content&mdash; The License to revere,

A privilege so awful

What would the Dower be,

Had I the Art to stun myself

With Bolts of Melody!

I Years had been from Home


I Years had been from Home

And now before the Door

I dared not enter, lest a Face

I never saw before

Stare solid into mine

And ask my Business there&mdash;

"My Business but a Life I left

Was such remaining there?"

I leaned upon the Awe&mdash;

I lingered with Before&mdash;

The Second like an Ocean rolled

And broke against my ear&mdash;

I laughed a crumbling Laugh

That I could fear a Door

Who Consternation compassed

And never winced before.

I fitted to the Latch

My Hand, with trembling care

Lest back the awful Door should spring And leave me in the Floor&mdash;

Then moved my Fingers off

As cautiously as Glass

And held my ears, and like a Thief

Fled gasping from the House&mdash; Emily Dickinson





I years had been from home,

I years had been from home,

And now, before the door,

I dared not open, lest a face

I never saw before

Stare vacant into mine

And ask my business there.

My business,--just a life I left,

Was such still dwelling there?

I fumbled at my nerve,

I scanned the windows near;

The silence like an ocean rolled,

And broke against my ear.

I laughed a wooden laugh

That I could fear a door,

Who danger and the dead had faced,

But never quaked before.

I fitted to the latch

My hand, with trembling care,

Lest back the awful door should spring, And leave me standing there.

I moved my fingers off

As cautiously as glass,

And held my ears, and like a thief

Fled gasping from the house.

Emily Dickinson





I’ll tell you how the sun rose

I’ll tell you how the sun rose, -

A ribbon at a time.

The steeples swam in amethyst,

The news like squirrels ran.

The hills untied their bonnets,

The bobolinks begun.

Then I said softly to myself,

"That must have been the sun!"

But how he set, I know not.

There seemed a purple stile.

Which little yellow boys and girls

Were climbing all the while

Till when they reached the other side, A dominie in gray

Put gently up the evening bars,

And led the flock away.

Emily Dickinson





Ideals are the Fairly Oil


Ideals are the Fairly Oil

With which we help the Wheel

But when the Vital Axle turns

The Eye rejects the Oil.

Emily Dickinson






If any sink, assure that this, now standing&mdash; Failed like Themselves&mdash;and conscious that it rose&mdash; Grew by the Fact, and not the Understanding How Weakness passed&mdash;or Force&mdash;arose&mdash; Tell that the Worst, is easy in a Moment&mdash; Dread, but the Whizzing, before the Ball&mdash; When the Ball enters, enters Silence&mdash; Dying&mdash;annuls the power to kill.

Emily Dickinson





If anybody's friend be dead


If anybody's friend be dead

It's sharpest of the theme

The thinking how they walked alive&mdash; At such and such a time&mdash;

Their costume, of a Sunday,

Some manner of the Hair&mdash;

A prank nobody knew but them

Lost, in the Sepulchre&mdash;

How warm, they were, on such a day,

You almost feel the date&mdash;

So short way off it seems&mdash;

And now&mdash;they're Centuries from that&mdash; How pleased they were, at what you said&mdash; You try to touch the smile

And dip your fingers in the frost&mdash; When was it&mdash;Can you tell&mdash; You asked the Company to tea&mdash; Acquaintance&mdash;just a few&mdash; And chatted close with this Grand Thing That don't remember you&mdash;

Past Bows, and Invitations&mdash;

Past Interview, and Vow&mdash;

Past what Ourself can estimate&mdash; That&mdash;makes the Quick of Woe!

Emily Dickinson

'Twas prudenter—I thought—

And He—I pushed—with sudden force—

In face of the Suspense—

"Was buried"—"Buried"! "He!"

My Life just holds the Trench—

Emily Dickinson





If I Can Stop One Heart from Breaking

If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain;

If I can ease one life the aching,

Or cool one pain,

Or help one fainting robin

Unto his nest again,

I shall not live in vain.

Emily Dickinson





If I can stop one heart from breaking, If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain;

If I can ease one life the aching,

Or cool one pain,

Or help one fainting robin

Unto his nest again,

I shall not live in vain.

Emily Dickinson





If I could bribe them by a Rose


If I could bribe them by a Rose

I'd bring them every flower that grows From Amherst to Cashmere!

I would not stop for night, or storm&mdash; Or frost, or death, or anyone&mdash; My business were so dear!

If they would linger for a Bird

My Tambourin were soonest heard

Among the April Woods!

Unwearied, all the summer long,

Only to break in wilder song

When Winter shook the boughs!

What if they hear me!

Who shall say

That such an importunity

May not at last avail?

That, weary of this Beggar's face&mdash; They may not finally say, Yes&mdash; To drive her from the Hall?

Emily Dickinson





If I may have it, when it's dead


If I may have it, when it's dead,

I'll be contented&mdash;so&mdash; If just as soon as Breath is out

It shall belong to me&mdash;

Until they lock it in the Grave,

'Tis Bliss I cannot weigh&mdash;

For tho' they lock Thee in the Grave,

Myself&mdash;can own the key&mdash; Think of it Lover! I and Thee

Permitted&mdash;face to face to be&mdash; After a Life&mdash;a Death&mdash;We'll say&mdash; For Death was That&mdash;

And this&mdash;is Thee&mdash;

I'll tell Thee All&mdash;how Bald it grew&mdash; How Midnight felt, at first&mdash;to me&mdash; How all the Clocks stopped in the World&mdash; And Sunshine pinched me&mdash;'Twas so cold&mdash; Then how the Grief got sleepy&mdash;some&mdash; As if my Soul were deaf and dumb&mdash; Just making signs&mdash;across&mdash;to Thee&mdash; That this way&mdash;thou could'st notice me&mdash; I'll tell you how I tried to keep

A smile, to show you, when this Deep

All Waded&mdash;We look back for Play, At those Old Times&mdash;in Calvary, Forgive me, if the Grave come slow&mdash; For Coveting to look at Thee&mdash; Forgive me, if to stroke thy frost

Outvisions Paradise!

Emily Dickinson





If I should cease to bring a Rose


If I should cease to bring a Rose

Upon a festal day,

'Twill be because beyond the Rose

I have been called away&mdash;

If I should cease to take the names

My buds commemorate&mdash;

'Twill be because Death's finger

Claps my murmuring lip!

Emily Dickinson





If I should die


If I should die,

And you should live&mdash;

And time should gurgle on&mdash;

And morn should beam&mdash;

And noon should burn&mdash;

As it has usual done&mdash;

If Birds should build as early

And Bees as bustling go&mdash;

One might depart at option

From enterprise below!

'Tis sweet to know that stocks will stand When we with Daisies lie&mdash;

That Commerce will continue&mdash; And Trades as briskly fly&mdash;

It makes the parting tranquil

And keeps the soul serene&mdash;

That gentlemen so sprightly

Conduct the pleasing scene!

Emily Dickinson





If I shouldn't be alive


If I shouldn't be alive

When the Robins come,

Give the one in Red Cravat,

A Memorial crumb.

If I couldn't thank you,

Being fast asleep,

You will know I'm trying

Why my Granite lip!

Emily Dickinson





If I'm lost&mdash;now


If I'm lost&mdash;now

That I was found&mdash;

Shall still my transport be&mdash; That once&mdash;on me&mdash;those Jasper Gates Blazed open&mdash;suddenly&mdash; That in my awkward&mdash;gazing&mdash;face&mdash; The Angels&mdash;softly peered&mdash; And touched me with their fleeces,

Almost as if they cared&mdash;

I'm banished&mdash;now&mdash;you know it&mdash; How foreign that can be&mdash;

You'll know&mdash;Sir&mdash;when the Savior's face Turns so&mdash;away from you&mdash; Emily Dickinson

If it had no pencil


If it had no pencil

Would it try mine&mdash;

Worn&mdash;now&mdash;and dull&mdash;sweet, Writing much to thee.

If it had no word,

Would it make the Daisy,

Most as big as I was,

When it plucked me?

Emily Dickinson





If pain for peace prepares


If pain for peace prepares

Lo, what "Augustan" years

Our feet await!

If springs from winter rise,

Can the Anemones

Be reckoned up?

If night stands fast&mdash;then noon To gird us for the sun,

What gaze!

When from a thousand skies

On our developed eyes

Noons blaze!

Emily Dickinson





If recollecting were forgetting


If recollecting were forgetting,

Then I remember not.

And if forgetting, recollecting,

How near I had forgot.

And if to miss, were merry,

And to mourn, were gay,

How very blithe the fingers

That gathered this, Today!

Emily Dickinson





If she had been the Mistletoe


If she had been the Mistletoe

And I had been the Rose&mdash;

How gay upon your table

My velvet life to close&mdash;

Since I am of the Druid,

And she is of the dew&mdash;

I'll deck Tradition's buttonhole&mdash; And send the Rose to you.

Emily Dickinson





If the foolish, call them


If the foolish, call them "flowers"—

Need the wiser, tell?

If the Savants "Classify" them It is just as well!

Those who read the "Revelations"

Must not criticize

Those who read the same Edition—

With beclouded Eyes!

Could we stand with that Old "Moses"—

"Canaan" denied—

Scan like him, the stately landscape

On the other side—

Doubtless, we should deem superfluous

Many Sciences,

Not pursued by learned Angels

In scholastic skies!

Low amid that glad Belles lettres

Grant that we may stand,

Stars, amid profound Galaxies—

At that grand "Right hand"!

If this is "fading"


If this is "fading"

Oh let me immediately "fade"!

If this is "dying"

Bury me, in such a shroud of red!

If this is "sleep,"

On such a night

How proud to shut the eye!

Good Evening, gentle Fellow men!

Peacock presumes to die!

If those I loved were lost


If those I loved were lost

The Crier's voice would tell me&mdash; If those I loved were found

The bells of Ghent would ring&mdash; Did those I loved repose

The Daisy would impel me.

Philip&mdash;when bewildered

Bore his riddle in!

If you were coming in the Fall


If you were coming in the Fall,

I'd brush the Summer by

With half a smile, and half a spurn,

As Housewives do, a Fly.

If I could see you in a year,

I'd wind the months in balls&mdash; And put them each in separate Drawers, For fear the numbers fuse&mdash;

If only Centuries, delayed,

I'd count them on my Hand,

Subtracting, till my fingers dropped

Into Van Dieman's Land.

If certain, when this life was out&mdash; That yours and mine, should be

I'd toss it yonder, like a Rind,

And take Eternity&mdash;

But, now, uncertain of the length

Of this, that is between,

It goads me, like the Goblin Bee&mdash; That will not state&mdash;its sting.

Into Van Diemen's land.

If certain, when this life was out,

That yours and mine should be,

I'd toss it yonder like a rind,

And taste eternity.

But now, all ignorant of the length

Of time's uncertain wing,

It goads me, like the goblin bee,

That will not state its sting.

If your Nerve, deny you


If your Nerve, deny you&mdash;

Go above your Nerve&mdash;

He can lean against the Grave,

If he fear to swerve&mdash;

That's a steady posture&mdash;

Never any bend

Held of those Brass arms&mdash;

Best Giant made&mdash;

If your Soul seesaw&mdash;

Lift the Flesh door&mdash;

The Poltroon wants Oxygen&mdash;

Nothing more&mdash;

I'll send the feather from my Hat!


I'll send the feather from my Hat!

As trinket&mdash;worn by faded Child&mdash; Confronting eyes long&mdash;comforted&mdash; Blisters the Adamant!

I'll tell you how the Sun rose


I'll tell you how the Sun rose&mdash; A Ribbon at a time&mdash;

The Steeples swam in Amethyst&mdash; The news, like Squirrels, ran&mdash; The Hills untied their Bonnets&mdash; The Bobolinks&mdash;begun&mdash; Then I said softly to myself&mdash;

"That must have been the Sun"!

But how he set&mdash;I know not&mdash; There seemed a purple stile

That little Yellow boys and girls

Were climbing all the while&mdash; Till when they reached the other side, A Dominie in Gray&mdash;

Put gently up the evening Bars&mdash; And led the flock away&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





I'll tell you how the sun rose, --

I'll tell you how the sun rose, --

A ribbon at a time.

The steeples swam in amethyst,

The news like squirrels ran.

The hill untied their bonnets,

The bobolinks begun.

Then I said softly to myself,

'That must have been the sun!'

...................................

But how he set, I know not.

There seemed a purple stile

Which little yellow boys and girls

Were climbing all the while

Till when they reached the other side, A dominie in gray

Put gently up the evening bars, --

And led the flock away.

Emily Dickinson





I'm


I'm "wife"—I've finished that—

That other state—

I'm Czar—I'm "Woman" now—

It's safer so—

How odd the Girl's life looks

Behind this soft Eclipse—

I think that Earth feels so

To folks in Heaven—now—

This being comfort—then

That other kind—was pain—

But why compare?

I'm "Wife"! Stop there!

With water, in the country church

Is finished using, now,

But this time, consciously, of Grace&mdash; Unto supremest name&mdash;

Called to my Full&mdash;The Crescent dropped&mdash; Existence's whole Arc, filled up,

With one small Diadem.

My second Rank&mdash;too small the first&mdash; Crowned&mdash;Crowing&mdash;on my Father's breast&mdash; A half unconscious Queen&mdash;

But this time&mdash;Adequate&mdash;Erect, With Will to choose, or to reject,

I'm nobody! Who are you?

I'm nobody! Who are you?

Are you nobody, too?

Then there's a pair of us -- don't tell!

They'd advertise -- you know!

How dreary to be somebody!

How public like a frog

To tell one's name the livelong day

To an admiring bog!

I'm saying every day


I'm saying every day

"If I should be a Queen, tomorrow"&mdash; I'd do this way&mdash;

And so I deck, a little,

If it be, I wake a Bourbon,

None on me, bend supercilious&mdash; With "This was she&mdash;

Begged in the Market place&mdash;

Yesterday."

Court is a stately place&mdash;

I've heard men say&mdash;

So I loop my apron, against the Majesty With bright Pins of Buttercup&mdash; That not too plain&mdash;

Rank&mdash;overtake me&mdash;

And perch my Tongue

On Twigs of singing&mdash;rather high&mdash; But this, might be my brief Term

To qualify&mdash;

Put from my simple speech all plain word&mdash; Take other accents, as such I heard

Though but for the Cricket&mdash;just, And but for the Bee&mdash;

Not in all the Meadow&mdash;

One accost me&mdash;

Better to be ready&mdash;

Than did next morn

Meet me in Aragon&mdash;

My old Gown&mdash;on&mdash;

And the surprised Air

Rustics&mdash;wear&mdash;

Summoned&mdash;unexpectedly&mdash; To Exeter&mdash;

I'm sorry for the Dead&mdash;Today&mdash; It's such congenial times

Old Neighbors have at fences&mdash; It's time o' year for Hay.

And Broad&mdash;Sunburned Acquaintance Discourse between the Toil&mdash;

And laugh, a homely species

That makes the Fences smile&mdash; It seems so straight to lie away

From all of the noise of Fields&mdash; The Busy Carts&mdash;the fragrant Cocks&mdash; The Mower's Metre&mdash;Steals&mdash; A Trouble lest they're homesick&mdash; Those Farmers&mdash;and their Wives&mdash; Set separate from the Farming&mdash; And all the Neighbors' lives&mdash; A Wonder if the Sepulchre

Don't feel a lonesome way&mdash;

When Men&mdash;and Boys&mdash;and Carts&mdash;and June, Go down the Fields to "Hay"&mdash; Emily Dickinson

I'm the little


I'm the little "Heart's Ease"!

I don't care for pouting skies!

If the Butterfly delay

Can I, therefore, stay away?

If the Coward Bumble Bee

In his chimney corner stay,

I, must resoluter be!

Who'll apologize for me?

Dear, Old fashioned, little flower!

Eden is old fashioned, too!

Birds are antiquated fellows!

Heaven does not change her blue.

Nor will I, the little Heart's Ease—

Ever be induced to do!

Impossibility, like Wine


Impossibility, like Wine

Exhilarates the Man

Who tastes it; Possibility

Is flavorless&mdash;Combine

A Chance's faintest Tincture

And in the former Dram

Enchantment makes ingredient

As certainly as Doom&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





In Ebon Box, when years have flown


In Ebon Box, when years have flown

To reverently peer,

Wiping away the velvet dust

Summers have sprinkled there!

To hold a letter to the light&mdash; Grown Tawny now, with time&mdash;

To con the faded syllables

That quickened us like Wine!

Perhaps a Flower's shrivelled check

Among its stores to find&mdash;

Plucked far away, some morning&mdash; By gallant&mdash;mouldering hand!

A curl, perhaps, from foreheads

Our Constancy forgot&mdash;

Perhaps, an Antique trinket&mdash; In vanished fashions set!

And then to lay them quiet back&mdash; And go about its care&mdash;

As if the little Ebon Box

Were none of our affair!

In falling Timbers buried&mdash;

There breathed a Man&mdash;

Outside&mdash;the spades&mdash;were plying&mdash; The Lungs&mdash;within&mdash;

Could He&mdash;know&mdash;they sought Him&mdash; Could They&mdash;know&mdash;He breathed&mdash; Horrid Sand Partition&mdash;

Neither&mdash;could be heard&mdash; Never slacked the Diggers&mdash;

But when Spades had done&mdash;

Oh, Reward of Anguish,

It was dying&mdash;Then&mdash; Many Things&mdash;are fruitless&mdash;

But there is no Gratitude

Like the Grace&mdash;of Death&mdash; Emily Dickinson






In lands I never saw&mdash;they say Immortal Alps look down&mdash;

Whose Bonnets touch the firmament&mdash; Whose Sandals touch the town&mdash; Meek at whose everlasting feet

A Myriad Daisy play&mdash;

Which, Sir, are you and which am I

Upon an August day?

In rags mysterious as these


In rags mysterious as these

The shining Courtiers go&mdash;

Veiling the purple, and the plumes&mdash; Veiling the ermine so.

Smiling, as they request an alms&mdash; At some imposing door!

Smiling when we walk barefoot

Upon their golden floor!

Emily Dickinson





In Winter in my Room


In Winter in my Room

I came upon a Worm&mdash;

Pink, lank and warm&mdash;

But as he was a worm

And worms presume

Not quite with him at home&mdash;

Secured him by a string

To something neighboring

And went along.

A Trifle afterward

A thing occurred

I'd not believe it if I heard

But state with creeping blood&mdash; A snake with mottles rare

Surveyed my chamber floor

In feature as the worm before

But ringed with power&mdash;

The very string with which

I tied him&mdash;too

When he was mean and new

That string was there&mdash;

I shrank&mdash;"How fair you are"!

Propitiation's claw&mdash;

"Afraid," he hissed

"Of me"?

"No cordiality"&mdash;

He fathomed me&mdash;

Then to a Rhythm Slim

Secreted in his Form

As Patterns swim

Projected him.

That time I flew

Both eyes his way

Lest he pursue

Nor ever ceased to run

Till in a distant Town

Towns on from mine

I set me down

This was a dream.

Emily Dickinson





Inconceivably solemn!


Inconceivably solemn!

Things go gay

Pierce&mdash;by the very Press

Of Imagery&mdash;

Their far Parades&mdash;order on the eye With a mute Pomp&mdash;

A pleading Pageantry&mdash;

Flags, are a brave sight&mdash;

But no true Eye

Ever went by One&mdash;

Steadily&mdash;

Music's triumphant&mdash;

But the fine Ear

Winces with delight

Are Drums too near&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Is Bliss then, such Abyss


Is Bliss then, such Abyss,

I must not put my foot amiss

For fear I spoil my shoe?

I'd rather suit my foot

Than save my Boot&mdash;

For yet to buy another Pair

Is possible,

At any store&mdash;

But Bliss, is sold just once.

The Patent lost

None buy it any more&mdash;

Say, Foot, decide the point&mdash; The Lady cross, or not?

Verdict for Boot!

Emily Dickinson





Is it dead&mdash;Find it


Is it dead&mdash;Find it&mdash; Out of sound&mdash;Out of sight&mdash;

"Homesick"? Many met it&mdash; Even through them&mdash;This

Cannot testify&mdash;

Themself&mdash;as dumb&mdash;

Is it true, dear Sue?


Is it true, dear Sue?

Are there two?

I shouldn't like to come

For fear of joggling Him!

If I could shut him up

In a Coffee Cup,

Or tie him to a pin

Till I got in&mdash;

Or make him fast

To "Toby's" fist&mdash;

Hist! Whist! I'd come!

Emily Dickinson






It always felt to me&mdash;a wrong To that Old Moses&mdash;done&mdash; To let him see&mdash;the Canaan&mdash; Without the entering&mdash;

And tho' in soberer moments&mdash; No Moses there can be

I'm satisfied&mdash;the Romance

In point of injury&mdash;

Surpasses sharper stated&mdash;

Of Stephen&mdash;or of Paul&mdash; For these&mdash;were only put to death&mdash; While God's adroiter will

On Moses&mdash;seemed to fasten

With tantalizing Play

As Boy&mdash;should deal with lesser Boy&mdash; To prove ability.

The fault&mdash;was doubtless Israel's&mdash; Myself&mdash;had banned the Tribes&mdash; And ushered Grand Old Moses

In Pentateuchal Robes

Upon the Broad Possession

'Twas little&mdash;But titled Him&mdash;to see&mdash; Old Man on Nebo! Late as this&mdash; My justice bleeds&mdash;for Thee!

It bloomed and dropt, a Single Noon


It bloomed and dropt, a Single Noon&mdash; The Flower&mdash;distinct and Red&mdash; I, passing, thought another Noon

Another in its stead

Will equal glow, and thought no More

But came another Day

To find the Species disappeared&mdash; The Same Locality&mdash;

The Sun in place&mdash;no other fraud On Nature's perfect Sum&mdash;

Had I but lingered Yesterday&mdash; Was my retrieveless blame&mdash;

Much Flowers of this and further Zones Have perished in my Hands

For seeking its Resemblance&mdash; But unapproached it stands&mdash;

The single Flower of the Earth

That I, in passing by

Unconscious was&mdash;Great Nature's Face Passed infinite by Me&mdash;

It can't be


It can't be "Summer"!

That—got through!

It's early—yet—for "Spring"!

There's that long town of White—to cross—

Before the Blackbirds sing!

It can't be "Dying"!

It's too Rouge—

The Dead shall go in White—

So Sunset shuts my question down

With Cuffs of Chrysolite!

Emily Dickinson





It can't be "Summer"!


It can't be "Summer"!

That&mdash;got through!

It's early&mdash;yet&mdash;for "Spring"!

There's that long town of White&mdash;to cross&mdash; Before the Blackbirds sing!

It can't be "Dying"!

It's too Rouge&mdash;

The Dead shall go in White&mdash;

So Sunset shuts my question down

With Cuffs of Chrysolite!

Emily Dickinson





It ceased to hurt me, though so slow


It ceased to hurt me, though so slow

I could not feel the Anguish go&mdash; But only knew by looking back&mdash; That something&mdash;had benumbed the Track&mdash; Nor when it altered, I could say,

For I had worn it, every day,

As constant as the Childish frock&mdash; I hung upon the Peg, at night.

But not the Grief&mdash;that nestled close As needles&mdash;ladies softly press To Cushions Cheeks&mdash;

To keep their place&mdash;

Nor what consoled it, I could trace&mdash; Except, whereas 'twas Wilderness&mdash; It's better&mdash;almost Peace&mdash; Emily Dickinson





It did not surprise me


It did not surprise me&mdash;

So I said&mdash;or thought&mdash; She will stir her pinions

And the nest forgot,

Traverse broader forests&mdash;

Build in gayer boughs,

Breathe in Ear more modern

God's old fashioned vows&mdash;

This was but a Birdling&mdash;

What and if it be

One within my bosom

Had departed me?

This was but a story&mdash;

What and if indeed

There were just such coffin

In the heart instead?

Emily Dickinson






It don't sound so terrible&mdash;quite&mdash;as it did&mdash; I run it over&mdash;"Dead", Brain, "Dead."

Put it in Latin&mdash;left of my school&mdash; Seems it don't shriek so&mdash;under rule.

Turn it, a little&mdash;full in the face A Trouble looks bitterest&mdash;

Shift it&mdash;just&mdash;

Say "When Tomorrow comes this way&mdash; I shall have waded down one Day."

I suppose it will interrupt me some

Till I get accustomed&mdash;but then the Tomb Like other new Things&mdash;shows largest&mdash;then&mdash; And smaller, by Habit&mdash;

It's shrewder then

Put the Thought in advance&mdash;a Year&mdash; How like "a fit"&mdash;then&mdash; Murder&mdash;wear!

Emily Dickinson

A Trouble looks bitterest—

It Dropped So Low -- In My Regard --

It dropped so low -- in my Regard --

I heard it hit the Ground --

And go to pieces on the Stones

At bottom of my Mind --

Yet blamed the Fate that flung it -- less Than I denounced Myself,

For entertaining Plated Wares

Upon My Silver Shelf --

Emily Dickinson





It dropped so low in my regard

It dropped so low in my regard

I heard it hit the ground,

And go to pieces on the stones

At bottom of my mind;

Yet blamed the fate that fractured, less Than I reviled myself

For entertaining plated wares

Upon my silver shelf.

It feels a shame to be Alive


It feels a shame to be Alive&mdash; When Men so brave&mdash;are dead&mdash; One envies the Distinguished Dust&mdash; Permitted&mdash;such a Head&mdash; The Stone&mdash;that tells defending Whom This Spartan put away

What little of Him we&mdash;possessed In Pawn for Liberty&mdash;

The price is great&mdash;Sublimely paid&mdash; Do we deserve&mdash;a Thing&mdash; That lives&mdash;like Dollars&mdash;must be piled Before we may obtain?

Are we that wait&mdash;sufficient worth&mdash; That such Enormous Pearl

As life&mdash;dissolved be&mdash;for Us&mdash; In Battle's&mdash;horrid Bowl?

It may be&mdash;a Renown to live&mdash; I think the Man who die&mdash;

Those unsustained&mdash;Saviors&mdash; Present Divinity&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





It is a lonesome Glee


It is a lonesome Glee&mdash;

Yet sanctifies the Mind&mdash;

With fair association&mdash;

Afar upon the Wind

A Bird to overhear

Delight without a Cause&mdash;

Arrestless as invisible&mdash;

A matter of the Skies.

Emily Dickinson





It is an honorable Thought


It is an honorable Thought

And make One lift One's Hat

As One met sudden Gentlefolk

Upon a daily Street

That We've immortal Place

Though Pyramids decay

And Kingdoms, like the Orchard

Flit Russetly away

Emily Dickinson

It is easy to work when the soul is at play&mdash; But when the soul is in pain&mdash; The hearing him put his playthings up

Makes work difficult&mdash;then&mdash; It is simple, to ache in the Bone, or the Rind&mdash; But Gimlets&mdash;among the nerve&mdash; Mangle daintier&mdash;terribler&mdash; Like a Panter in the Glove&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





It knew no lapse, nor Diminuation


It knew no lapse, nor Diminuation&mdash; But large&mdash;serene&mdash;

Burned on&mdash;until through Dissolution&mdash; It failed from Men&mdash;

I could not deem these Planetary forces Annulled&mdash;

But suffered an Exchange of Territory&mdash; Or World&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





It knew no Medicine


It knew no Medicine&mdash;

It was not Sickness&mdash;then&mdash; Nor any need of Surgery&mdash;

And therefore&mdash;'twas not Pain&mdash; It moved away the Cheeks&mdash;

A Dimple at a time&mdash;

And left the Profile&mdash;plainer&mdash; And in the place of Bloom

It left the little Tint

That never had a Name&mdash;

You've seen it on a Cast's face&mdash; Was Paradise&mdash;to blame&mdash; If momently ajar&mdash;

Temerity&mdash;drew near&mdash; And sickened&mdash;ever afterward

For Somewhat that it saw?

Emily Dickinson





It makes no difference abroad


It makes no difference abroad&mdash; The Seasons&mdash;fit&mdash;the same&mdash; The Mornings blossom into Noons&mdash; And split their Pods of Flame&mdash; Wild flowers&mdash;kindle in the Woods&mdash; The Brooks slam&mdash;all the Day&mdash; No Black bird bates his Banjo&mdash; For passing Calvary&mdash;

Auto da Fe&mdash;and Judgment&mdash; Are nothing to the Bee&mdash;

His separation from His Rose&mdash; To Him&mdash;sums Misery&mdash; Emily Dickinson





It might be lonelier


It might be lonelier

Without the Loneliness&mdash;

I'm so accustomed to my Fate&mdash; Perhaps the Other&mdash;Peace&mdash; Would interrupt the Dark&mdash;

And crowd the little Room&mdash;

Too scant&mdash;by Cubits&mdash;to contain The Sacrament&mdash;of Him&mdash; I am not used to Hope&mdash;

It might intrude upon&mdash;

Its sweet parade&mdash;blaspheme the place&mdash; Ordained to Suffering&mdash;

It might be easier

To fail&mdash;with Land in Sight&mdash; Than gain&mdash;My Blue Peninsula&mdash; To perish&mdash;of Delight&mdash; Emily Dickinson





It sifts from Leaden Sieves


It sifts from Leaden Sieves&mdash; It powders all the Wood.

It fills with Alabaster Wool

The Wrinkles of the Road&mdash;

It makes an Even Face

Of Mountain, and of Plain&mdash;

Unbroken Forehead from the East

Unto the East again&mdash;

It reaches to the Fence&mdash;

It wraps it Rail by Rail

Till it is lost in Fleeces&mdash;

It deals Celestial Vail

To Stump, and Stack&mdash;and Stem&mdash; A Summer's empty Room&mdash;

Acres of Joints, where Harvests were,

Recordless, but for them--

It Ruffles Wrists of Posts

As Ankles of a Queen&mdash;

Then stills its Artisans&mdash;like Ghosts&mdash; Denying they have been&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





It struck me every day

It struck me every day

The lightning was as new

As if the cloud that instant slit

And let the fire through.

It burned me in the night,

It blistered in my dream;

It sickened fresh upon my sight

With every morning's beam.

I thought that storm was brief,--

The maddest, quickest by;

But Nature lost the date of this,

And left it in the sky.

Emily Dickinson





It struck me&mdash;every Day


It struck me&mdash;every Day&mdash; The Lightning was as new

As if the Cloud that instant slit

And let the Fire through&mdash;

It burned Me&mdash;in the Night&mdash; It Blistered to My Dream&mdash;

It sickened fresh upon my sight&mdash; With every Morn that came&mdash;

I though that Storm&mdash;was brief&mdash; The Maddest&mdash;quickest by&mdash; But Nature lost the Date of This&mdash; And left it in the Sky&mdash;

Emily Dickinson

It tossed&mdash;and tossed


It tossed&mdash;and tossed&mdash; A little Brig I knew&mdash;o'ertook by Blast&mdash; It spun&mdash;and spun&mdash;

And groped delirious, for Morn&mdash; It slipped&mdash;and slipped&mdash; As One that drunken&mdash;stept&mdash; Its white foot tripped&mdash;

Then dropped from sight&mdash;

Ah, Brig&mdash;Good Night

To Crew and You&mdash;

The Ocean's Heart too smooth&mdash;too Blue&mdash; To break for You&mdash;

It troubled me as once I was


It troubled me as once I was&mdash; For I was once a Child&mdash;

Concluding how an Atom&mdash;fell&mdash; And yet the Heavens&mdash;held&mdash; The Heavens weighed the most&mdash;by far&mdash; Yet Blue&mdash;and solid&mdash;stood&mdash; Without a Bolt&mdash;that I could prove&mdash; Would Giants&mdash;understand?

Life set me larger&mdash;problems&mdash; Some I shall keep&mdash;to solve

Till Algebra is easier&mdash;

Or simpler proved&mdash;above&mdash; Then&mdash;too&mdash;be comprehended&mdash; What sorer&mdash;puzzled me&mdash; Why Heaven did not break away&mdash; And tumble&mdash;Blue&mdash;on me&mdash; Emily Dickinson





It was a Grave, yet bore no Stone


It was a Grave, yet bore no Stone

Enclosed 'twas not of Rail

A Consciousness its Acre, and

It held a Human Soul.

Entombed by whom, for what offence

If Home or Foreign born&mdash;

Had I the curiosity

'Twere not appeased of men

Till Resurrection, I must guess

Denied the small desire

A Rose upon its Ridge to sow

Or take away a Briar.

Emily Dickinson





It was given to me by the Gods


It was given to me by the Gods&mdash; When I was a little Girl&mdash;

They given us Presents most&mdash;you know&mdash; When we are new&mdash;and small.

I kept it in my Hand&mdash;

I never put it down&mdash;

I did not dare to eat&mdash;or sleep&mdash; For fear it would be gone&mdash;

I heard such words as "Rich"&mdash; When hurrying to school&mdash;

From lips at Corners of the Streets&mdash; And wrestled with a smile.

Rich! 'Twas Myself&mdash;was rich&mdash; To take the name of Gold&mdash;

And Gold to own&mdash;in solid Bars&mdash; The Difference&mdash;made me bold&mdash; Emily Dickinson





It was not Death, for I stood up


It was not Death, for I stood up,

And all the Dead, lie down&mdash;

It was not Night, for all the Bells

Put out their Tongues, for Noon.

It was not Frost, for on my Flesh

I felt Siroccos&mdash;crawl&mdash; Nor Fire&mdash;for just my Marble feet Could keep a Chancel, cool&mdash;

And yet, it tasted, like them all,

The Figures I have seen

Set orderly, for Burial,

Reminded me, of mine&mdash;

As if my life were shaven,

And fitted to a frame,

And could not breathe without a key,

And 'twas like Midnight, some -

When everything that ticked&mdash;has stopped&mdash; And Space stares all around&mdash; Or Grisly frosts&mdash;first Autumn morns, Repeal the Beating Ground&mdash;

But, most, like Chaos - Stopless&mdash;cool&mdash; Without a Change, or Spar&mdash;

Or even a Report of Land&mdash;

To justify&mdash;Despair.

Emily Dickinson

Without a chance or spar,--

Or even a report of land

To justify despair.

It was too late for Man


It was too late for Man&mdash;

It would have starved a Gnat


It would have starved a Gnat&mdash; To live so small as I&mdash;

And yet I was a living Child&mdash; With Food's necessity

Upon me&mdash;like a Claw&mdash; I could no more remove

Than I could coax a Leech away&mdash; Or make a Dragon&mdash;move&mdash; Not like the Gnat&mdash;had I&mdash; The privilege to fly

And seek a Dinner for myself&mdash; How mightier He&mdash;than I&mdash; Nor like Himself&mdash;the Art

Upon the Window Pane

To gad my little Being out&mdash;

It's all I have to bring today


It's all I have to bring today&mdash; This, and my heart beside&mdash;

It's easy to invent a Life


It's easy to invent a Life&mdash;

God does it&mdash;every Day&mdash; Creation&mdash;but the Gambol

It's like the morning, --

Best when it's done, --

The everlasting clocks

Chime noon.

I've heard an Organ talk, sometimes


I've heard an Organ talk, sometimes

In a Cathedral Aisle,

And understood no word it said&mdash; Yet held my breath, the while&mdash; And risen up&mdash;and gone away,

A more Berdardine Girl&mdash;

Yet&mdash;know not what was done to me In that old Chapel Aisle.

Emily Dickinson





I've known a Heaven, like a Tent


I've known a Heaven, like a Tent&mdash; To wrap its shining Yards&mdash;

Pluck up its stakes, and disappear&mdash; Without the sound of Boards

Or Rip of Nail&mdash;Or Carpenter&mdash; But just the miles of Stare&mdash; That signalize a Show's Retreat&mdash; In North America&mdash;

No Trace&mdash;no Figment of the Thing That dazzled, Yesterday,

No Ring&mdash;no Marvel&mdash; Men, and Feats&mdash;

Dissolved as utterly&mdash;

As Bird's far Navigation

Discloses just a Hue&mdash;

A plash of Oars, a Gaiety&mdash;

Then swallowed up, of View.

Emily Dickinson





I've none to tell me to but Thee


I've none to tell me to but Thee

So when Thou failest, nobody.

It was a little tie&mdash;

It just held Two, nor those it held

Since Somewhere thy sweet Face has spilled Beyond my Boundary&mdash;

If things were opposite&mdash;and Me And Me it were&mdash;that ebbed from Thee On some unanswering Shore&mdash;

Would'st Thou seek so&mdash;just say That I the Answer may pursue

Unto the lips it eddied through&mdash; So&mdash;overtaking Thee&mdash; Emily Dickinson






I've nothing else&mdash;to bring, You know&mdash; So I keep bringing These&mdash;

Just as the Night keeps fetching Stars To our familiar eyes&mdash;

Maybe, we shouldn't mind them&mdash; Unless they didn't come&mdash;

Then&mdash;maybe, it would puzzle us To find our way Home&mdash;

I've seen a Dying Eye


I've seen a Dying Eye

Run round and round a Room&mdash;

In search of Something&mdash;as it seemed&mdash; Then Cloudier become&mdash;

And then&mdash;obscure with Fog&mdash; And then&mdash;be soldered down

Without disclosing what it be

'Twere blessed to have seen&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Jesus! thy Crucifix


Jesus! thy Crucifix

Enable thee to guess

The smaller size!

Jesus! thy second face

Mind thee in Paradise

Of ours!

Emily Dickinson





Joy to have merited the Pain


Joy to have merited the Pain&mdash; To merit the Release&mdash;

Joy to have perished every step&mdash; To Compass Paradise&mdash;

Pardon&mdash;to look upon thy face&mdash; With these old fashioned Eyes&mdash; Better than new&mdash;could be&mdash;for that&mdash; Though bought in Paradise&mdash;

Because they looked on thee before&mdash; And thou hast looked on them&mdash; Prove Me&mdash;My Hazel Witnesses

The features are the same&mdash;

So fleet thou wert, when present&mdash; So infinite&mdash;when gone&mdash; An Orient's Apparition&mdash;

Remanded of the Morn&mdash;

The Height I recollect&mdash;

'Twas even with the Hills&mdash;

The Depth upon my Soul was notched&mdash; As Floods&mdash;on Whites of Wheels&mdash; To Haunt&mdash;till Time have dropped His last Decade away,

And Haunting actualize&mdash;to last At least&mdash;Eternity&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Just as He spoke it from his Hands


Just as He spoke it from his Hands

This Edifice remain&mdash;

A Turret more, a Turret less

Dishonor his Design&mdash;

According as his skill prefer

It perish, or endure&mdash;

Content, soe'er, it ornament

His absent character.

Emily Dickinson





Just lost, when I was saved!


Just lost, when I was saved!

Just felt the world go by!

Just girt me for the onset with Eternity, When breath blew back,

And on the other side

I heard recede the disappointed tide!

Therefore, as One returned, I feel

Odd secrets of the line to tell!

Some Sailor, skirting foreign shores&mdash; Some pale Reporter, from the awful doors Before the Seal!

Next time, to stay!

Next time, the things to see

By Ear unheard,

Unscrutinized by Eye&mdash;

Next time, to tarry,

While the Ages steal&mdash;

Slow tramp the Centuries,

And the Cycles wheel!

Emily Dickinson






Just so&mdash;Jesus&mdash;raps&mdash; He&mdash;doesn't weary&mdash;

Last&mdash;at the Knocker&mdash; And first&mdash;at the Bell.

Then&mdash;on divinest tiptoe&mdash;standing&mdash; Might He but spy the lady's soul&mdash; When He&mdash;retires&mdash;

Chilled&mdash;or weary&mdash;

It will be ample time for&mdash;me&mdash; Patient&mdash;upon the steps&mdash;until then&mdash; Hears! I am knocking&mdash;low at thee.

Kill your Balm—and its Odors bless you—

Bare your Jessamine—to the storm—

And she will fling her maddest perfume—

Haply—your Summer night to Charm—

Stab the Bird—that built in your bosom—

Oh, could you catch her last Refrain—

Bubble! "forgive"—"Some better"—Bubble!

"Carol for Him—when I am gone"!

Knows how to forget!


Knows how to forget!

But could It teach it?

Easiest of Arts, they say

When one learn how

Dull Hearts have died

In the Acquisition

Sacrificed for Science

Is common, though, now&mdash;

I went to School

But was not wiser

Globe did not teach it

Nor Logarithm Show

"How to forget"!

Say&mdash;some&mdash;Philosopher!

Ah, to be erudite

Enough to know!

Is it in a Book?

So, I could buy it&mdash;

Is it like a Planet?

Telescopes would know&mdash;

If it be invention

It must have a Patent.

Rabbi of the Wise Book

Don't you know?

Let Us play Yesterday


Let Us play Yesterday&mdash;

I&mdash;the Girl at school&mdash; You&mdash;and Eternity&mdash;the Untold Tale&mdash;

Easing my famine

At my Lexicon&mdash;

Logarithm&mdash;had I&mdash;for Drink&mdash;

'Twas a dry Wine&mdash;

Somewhat different&mdash;must be&mdash; Dreams tint the Sleep&mdash;

Cunning Reds of Morning

Make the Blind&mdash;leap&mdash; Still at the Egg-life&mdash;

Chafing the Shell&mdash;

When you troubled the Ellipse&mdash; And the Bird fell&mdash;

Manacles be dim&mdash;they say&mdash; To the new Free&mdash;

Liberty&mdash;Commoner&mdash;

Never could&mdash;to me&mdash;

'Twas my last gratitude

When I slept&mdash;at night&mdash;

'Twas the first Miracle

Let in&mdash;with Light&mdash; Can the Lark resume the Shell&mdash; Easier&mdash;for the Sky&mdash; Wouldn't Bonds hurt more

Than Yesterday?

Wouldn't Dungeons sorer frate

On the Man&mdash;free&mdash;

Just long enough to taste&mdash;

Then&mdash;doomed new&mdash;

God of the Manacle

As of the Free&mdash;

Take not my Liberty

Away from Me&mdash;

Life&mdash;is what we make of it


Life&mdash;is what we make of it&mdash; Death&mdash;we do not know&mdash; Christ's acquaintance with Him

Justify Him&mdash;though&mdash; He&mdash;would trust no stranger&mdash; Other&mdash;could betray&mdash; Just His own endorsement&mdash;

Light is sufficient to itself


Light is sufficient to itself&mdash; If Others want to see

It can be had on Window Panes

Some Hours in the Day.

But not for Compensation&mdash;

It holds as large a Glow

To Squirrel in the Himmaleh

Precisely, as to you.

Emily Dickinson





Like eyes that looked on Wastes


Like eyes that looked on Wastes&mdash; Incredulous of Ought

But Blank&mdash;and steady Wilderness&mdash; Diversified by Night&mdash;

Just Infinites of Nought&mdash;

As far as it could see&mdash;

So looked the face I looked upon&mdash; So looked itself&mdash;on Me&mdash; I offered it no Help&mdash;

Because the Cause was Mine&mdash;

The Misery a Compact

As hopeless&mdash;as divine&mdash; Neither&mdash;would be absolved&mdash; Neither would be a Queen

Without the Other&mdash;Therefore&mdash; We perish&mdash;tho' We reign&mdash; Emily Dickinson






Like Flowers, that heard the news of Dews, But never deemed the dripping prize

Awaited their&mdash;low Brows&mdash; Or Bees&mdash;that thought the Summer's name Some rumor of Delirium,

No Summer&mdash;could&mdash;for Them&mdash; Or Arctic Creatures, dimly stirred&mdash; By Tropic Hint&mdash;some Travelled Bird Imported to the Wood&mdash;

Or Wind's bright signal to the Ear&mdash; Making that homely, and severe,

Contented, known, before&mdash;

The Heaven&mdash;unexpected come,

To Lives that thought the Worshipping

A too presumptuous Psalm&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Like her the Saints retire


Like her the Saints retire,

In their Chapeaux of fire,

Martial as she!

Like her the Evenings steal

Purple and Cochineal

After the Day!

"Departed"&mdash;both&mdash;they say!

i.e. gathered away,

Not found,

Argues the Aster still&mdash;

Reasons the Daffodil

Profound!

Emily Dickinson






Like Mighty Foot Lights&mdash;burned the Red At Bases of the Trees&mdash;

Like Some Old fashioned Miracle


Like Some Old fashioned Miracle

When Summertime is done&mdash;

Seems Summer's Recollection

And the Affairs of June

As infinite Tradition

As Cinderella's Bays&mdash;

Or Little John&mdash;of Lincoln Green&mdash; Or Blue Beard's Galleries&mdash;

Her Bees have a fictitious Hum&mdash; Her Blossoms, like a Dream&mdash;

Elate us&mdash;till we almost weep&mdash; So plausible&mdash;they seem&mdash; Her Memories like Strains&mdash;Review&mdash; When Orchestra is dumb&mdash;

The Violin in Baize replaced&mdash; And Ear&mdash;and Heaven&mdash;numb&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Like trains of cars on tracks of plush Like trains of cars on tracks of plush I hear the level bee:

A jar across the flowers goes,

Their velvet masonry

Withstands until the sweet assault

Their chivalry consumes,

While he, victorious, tilts away

To vanquish other blooms.

His feet are shod with gauze,

His helmet is of gold;

His breast, a single onyx

With chrysoprase, inlaid.

His labor is a chant,

His idleness a tune;

Oh, for a bee's experience

Of clovers and of noon!

Emily Dickinson

Low at my problem bending


Low at my problem bending,

Another problem comes&mdash;

Larger than mine&mdash;Serener&mdash; Involving statelier sums.

I check my busy pencil,

My figures file away.

Wherefore, my baffled fingers

They perplexity?

Emily Dickinson





Make me a picture of the sun


Make me a picture of the sun&mdash; So I can hang it in my room&mdash; And make believe I'm getting warm

When others call it "Day"!

Draw me a Robin&mdash;on a stem&mdash; So I am hearing him, I'll dream,

And when the Orchards stop their tune&mdash; Put my pretense&mdash;away&mdash; Say if it's really&mdash;warm at noon&mdash; Whether it's Buttercups&mdash;that "skim"&mdash; Or Butterflies&mdash;that "bloom"?

Then&mdash;skip&mdash;the frost&mdash;upon the lea&mdash; And skip the Russet&mdash;on the tree&mdash; Let's play those&mdash;never come!

Emily Dickinson





Mama never forgets her birds


Mama never forgets her birds,

Though in another tree&mdash;

She looks down just as often

And just as tenderly

As when her little mortal nest

With cunning care she wove&mdash;

If either of her "sparrows fall,"

She "notices," above.

Emily Dickinson






Many a phrase has the English language&mdash; I have heard but one&mdash;

Low as the laughter of the Cricket,

Loud, as the Thunder's Tongue&mdash; Murmuring, like old Caspian Choirs,

When the Tide's a' lull&mdash;

Saying itself in new infection&mdash; Like a Whippoorwill&mdash;

Breaking in bright Orthography

On my simple sleep&mdash;

Thundering its Prospective&mdash;

Till I stir, and weep&mdash;

Not for the Sorrow, done me&mdash; But the push of Joy&mdash;

Say it again, Saxton!

Hush&mdash;Only to me!

Emily Dickinson





Many cross the Rhine


Many cross the Rhine

In this cup of mine.

Sip old Frankfort air

From my brown Cigar.

That they pronounce my name.

Morns like these&mdash;we parted


Morns like these&mdash;we parted&mdash; Noons like these&mdash;she rose&mdash; Fluttering first&mdash;then firmer To her fair repose.

Never did she lisp it&mdash;

It was not for me&mdash;

She&mdash;was mute from transport&mdash; I&mdash;from agony&mdash;

Till&mdash;the evening nearing

One the curtains drew&mdash;

Quick! A Sharper rustling!

And this linnet flew!

Noons like these—she rose—

Fluttering first—then firmer

She—was mute from transport—

I—from agony—

Till—the evening nearing

One the curtains drew—

Quick! A Sharper rustling!

And this linnet flew!

Emily Dickinson





Most she touched me by her muteness


Most she touched me by her muteness&mdash; Most she won me by the way

She presented her small figure&mdash; Plea itself&mdash;for Charity&mdash; Were a Crumb my whole possession&mdash; Were there famine in the land&mdash; Were it my resource from starving&mdash; Could I such a plea withstand&mdash; Not upon her knee to thank me

Sank this Beggar from the Sky&mdash; But the Crumb partook&mdash;departed&mdash; And returned On High&mdash;

I supposed&mdash;when sudden

Such a Praise began

'Twas as Space sat singing

To herself&mdash;and men&mdash;

'Twas the Winged Beggar&mdash;

Afterward I learned

To her Benefactor

Making Gratitude

Emily Dickinson





Much Madness is divinest Sense

Much Madness is divinest Sense -

To a discerning Eye -

Much Sense - the starkest Madness -

`Tis the Majority

In this, as All, prevail -

Assent - and you are sane -

Demur - yoùre straightaway dangerous -

And handled with a Chain -

Emily Dickinson





Musicians wrestle everywhere


Musicians wrestle everywhere&mdash; All day&mdash;among the crowded air I hear the silver strife&mdash;

And&mdash;walking&mdash;long before the morn&mdash; Such transport breaks upon the town

I think it that "New Life"!

If is not Bird&mdash;it has no nest&mdash; Nor "Band"&mdash;in brass and scarlet&mdash;drest&mdash; Nor Tamborin&mdash;nor Man&mdash; It is not Hymn from pulpit read&mdash; The "Morning Stars" the Treble led On Time's first Afternoon!

Some&mdash;say&mdash;it is "the Spheres"&mdash;at play!

Some say that bright Majority

Of vanished Dames&mdash;and Men!

Some&mdash;think it service in the place Where we&mdash;with late&mdash;celestial face&mdash; Please God&mdash;shall Ascertain!

Emily Dickinson





Must be a Woe


Must be a Woe&mdash;

A loss or so&mdash;

To bend the eye

Best Beauty's way&mdash;

But&mdash;once aslant

It notes Delight

As difficult

As Stalactite

A Common Bliss

Were had for less&mdash;

The price&mdash;is

Even as the Grace&mdash;

Our lord&mdash;thought no

Extravagance

To pay&mdash;a Cross&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Mute thy Coronation


Mute thy Coronation&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





My best Acquaintances are those


My best Acquaintances are those

With Whom I spoke no Word&mdash;

Esteemed Me never rude

Although to their Celestial Call

I failed to make reply&mdash;

My constant&mdash;reverential Face Sufficient Courtesy.

My Faith is larger than the Hills


My Faith is larger than the Hills&mdash; So when the Hills decay&mdash;

My Faith must take the Purple Wheel

To show the Sun the way&mdash;

'Tis first He steps upon the Vane&mdash; And then&mdash;upon the Hill&mdash; And then abroad the World He go

To do His Golden Will&mdash;

And if His Yellow feet should miss&mdash; The Bird would not arise&mdash;

The Flowers would slumber on their Stems&mdash; No Bells have Paradise&mdash;

How dare I, therefore, stint a faith

On which so vast depends&mdash;

Lest Firmament should fail for me&mdash; The Rivet in the Bands

Emily Dickinson






My first well Day&mdash;since many ill&mdash; I asked to go abroad,

And take the Sunshine in my hands,

And see the things in Pod&mdash;

A 'blossom just when I went in

To take my Chance with pain&mdash; Uncertain if myself, or He,

Should prove the strongest One.

The Summer deepened, while we strove&mdash; She put some flowers away&mdash;

And Redder cheeked Ones&mdash;in their stead&mdash; A fond&mdash;illusive way&mdash; To cheat Herself, it seemed she tried&mdash; As if before a child

To fade&mdash;Tomorrow&mdash;Rainbows held The Sepulchre, could hide.

She dealt a fashion to the Nut&mdash; She tied the Hoods to Seeds&mdash; She dropped bright scraps of Tint, about&mdash; And left Brazilian Threads

On every shoulder that she met&mdash; Then both her Hands of Haze

Put up&mdash;to hide her parting Grace From our unfitted eyes.

My loss, by sickness&mdash;Was it Loss?

Or that Ethereal Gain

One earns by measuring the Grave&mdash; Then&mdash;measuring the Sun&mdash; Emily Dickinson

I asked to go abroad,

And take the Sunshine in my hands,

And see the things in Pod—

A 'blossom just when I went in

To take my Chance with pain—

Uncertain if myself, or He,

My friend attacks my friend!


My friend attacks my friend!

Oh Battle picturesque!

Then I turn Soldier too,

And he turns Satirist!

How martial is this place!

Had I a mighty gun

I think I'd shoot the human race

And then to glory run!

Emily Dickinson





My friend must be a Bird


My friend must be a Bird&mdash;

Because it flies!

Mortal, my friend must be,

Because it dies!

Barbs has it, like a Bee!

Ah, curious friend!

Thou puzzlest me!

Emily Dickinson

My life closed twice

My life closed twice before its close--

It yet remains to see

If Immortality unveil

A third event to me

So huge, so hopeless to conceive

As these that twice befell.

Parting is all we know of heaven,

And all we need of hell.

Emily Dickinson

My life had stood

My life had stood--a Loaded Gun--

In Corners--till a Day

The Owner passed--identified--

And carried Me away--

And now We roam in Sovereign Woods--

And now We hunt the Doe--

And every time I speak for Him--

The Mountains straight reply--

And do I smile, such cordial light

Upon the Valley glow--

It is as a Vesuvian face

Had let its pleasure through--

And when at Night--Our good Day done--

I guard My Master's Head--

'Tis better than the Eider-Duck's

Deep Pillow--to have shared--

To foe of His--I'm deadly foe--

None stir the second time--

On whom I lay a Yellow Eye--

Or an emphatic Thumb--

Though I than He--may longer live

He longer must--than I--

For I have but the power to kill,

Without--the power to die--

Emily Dickinson






My Life had stood&mdash;a Loaded Gun&mdash; In Corners&mdash;till a Day

The Owner passed&mdash;identified&mdash; And carried Me away&mdash;

And now We roam in Sovereign Woods&mdash; And now We hunt the Doe&mdash;

And every time I speak for Him&mdash; The Mountains straight reply&mdash; And do I smile, such cordial light

Upon the Valley glow&mdash;

It is as a Vesuvian face

Had let its pleasure through&mdash; And when at Night&mdash;Our good Day done&mdash; I guard My Master's Head&mdash;

'Tis better than the Eider-Duck's

Deep Pillow&mdash;to have shared&mdash; To foe of His&mdash;I'm deadly foe&mdash; None stir the second time&mdash;

On whom I lay a Yellow Eye&mdash;

Or an emphatic Thumb&mdash;

Though I than He&mdash;may longer live He longer must&mdash;than I&mdash; For I have but the power to kill,

Without&mdash;the power to die&mdash; Emily Dickinson





My nosegays are for Captives


My nosegays are for Captives&mdash; Dim&mdash;expectant eyes,

Fingers denied the plucking,

Patient till Paradise.

To such, if they should whisper

Of morning and the moor,

They bear no other errand,

And I, no other prayer.

Emily Dickinson





My nosegays are for captives;

My nosegays are for captives;

Dim, long-expectant eyes,

Fingers denied the plucking,

Patient till paradise.

To such, if they should whisper

Of morning and the moor,

They bear no other errand,

And I, no other prayer.

Emily Dickinson





My period had come for Prayer


My period had come for Prayer&mdash; No other Art&mdash;would do&mdash; My Tactics missed a rudiment&mdash; Creator&mdash;Was it you?

God grows above&mdash;so those who pray Horizons&mdash;must ascend&mdash; And so I stepped upon the North

To see this Curious Friend&mdash;

His House was not&mdash;no sign had He&mdash; By Chimney&mdash;nor by Door

Could I infer his Residence&mdash; Vast Prairies of Air

Unbroken by a Settler&mdash;

Were all that I could see&mdash;

Infinitude&mdash;Had'st Thou no Face That I might look on Thee?

The Silence condescended&mdash;

Creation stopped&mdash;for Me&mdash; But awed beyond my errand&mdash;

I worshipped&mdash;did not "pray"&mdash; Emily Dickinson





My Portion is Defeat&mdash;today


My Portion is Defeat&mdash;today&mdash; A paler luck than Victory&mdash;

Less Paeans&mdash;fewer Bells&mdash; The Drums don't follow Me&mdash;with tunes&mdash; Defeat&mdash;a somewhat slower&mdash;means&mdash; More Arduous than Balls&mdash;

'Tis populous with Bone and stain&mdash; And Men too straight to stoop again&mdash;, And Piles of solid Moan&mdash;

And Chips of Blank&mdash;in Boyish Eyes&mdash; And scraps of Prayer&mdash;

And Death's surprise,

Stamped visible&mdash;in Stone&mdash; There's somewhat prouder, over there&mdash; The Trumpets tell it to the Air&mdash; How different Victory

To Him who has it&mdash;and the One Who to have had it, would have been

Contender&mdash;to die&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





My Portion is Defeat—today


My Portion is Defeat—today—

A paler luck than Victory—

Less Paeans—fewer Bells—

The Drums don't follow Me—with tunes—

Defeat—a somewhat slower—means—

More Arduous than Balls—

'Tis populous with Bone and stain—

And Men too straight to stoop again—,

And Piles of solid Moan—

And Chips of Blank—in Boyish Eyes—

And scraps of Prayer—

And Death's surprise,

Stamped visible—in Stone—

There's somewhat prouder, over there—

The Trumpets tell it to the Air—

How different Victory

To Him who has it—and the One

Who to have had it, would have been

Contender—to die—

My Reward for Being, was This


My Reward for Being, was This.

My premium&mdash;My Bliss&mdash; An Admiralty, less&mdash;

A Sceptre&mdash;penniless&mdash; And Realms&mdash;just Dross&mdash; When Thrones accost my Hands&mdash; With "Me, Miss, Me"&mdash; I'll unroll Thee&mdash;

Dominions dowerless&mdash;beside this Grace&mdash; Election&mdash;Vote&mdash;

The Ballots of Eternity, will show just that.

Emily Dickinson





My River runs to thee


My River runs to thee&mdash;

Blue Sea! Wilt welcome me?

Oh Sea&mdash;look graciously&mdash; I'll fetch thee Brooks

From spotted nooks&mdash;

My Soul&mdash;accused me&mdash;And I quailed&mdash; As Tongue of Diamond had reviled

All else accused me&mdash;and I smiled&mdash; My Soul&mdash;that Morning&mdash;was My friend&mdash; Her favor&mdash;is the best Disdain Toward Artifice of Time&mdash;or Men&mdash; But Her Disdain&mdash;'twere lighter bear A finger of Enamelled Fire&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





My Soul—accused me—And I quailed


My Soul—accused me—And I quailed—

As Tongue of Diamond had reviled

All else accused me—and I smiled—

My Soul—that Morning—was My friend—

Her favor—is the best Disdain

Toward Artifice of Time—or Men—

But Her Disdain—'twere lighter bear

A finger of Enamelled Fire—

Emily Dickinson





My wheel is in the dark


My wheel is in the dark!

I cannot see a spoke

Yet know its dripping feet

Go round and round.

My foot is on the Tide!

An unfrequented road&mdash;

Yet have all roads

A clearing at the end&mdash;

Some have resigned the Loom&mdash; Some in the busy tomb

Find quaint employ&mdash;

Some with new&mdash;stately feet&mdash; Pass royal through the gate&mdash; Flinging the problem back

At you and I!

Emily Dickinson





My Worthiness is all my Doubt


My Worthiness is all my Doubt&mdash; His Merit&mdash;all my fear&mdash; Contrasting which, my quality

Do lowlier&mdash;appear&mdash; Lest I should insufficient prove

For His beloved Need&mdash;

The Chiefest Apprehension

Upon my thronging Mind&mdash;

'Tis true&mdash;that Deity to stoop Inherently incline&mdash;

For nothing higher than Itself

Itself can rest upon&mdash;

So I&mdash;the undivine abode

Of His Elect Content&mdash;

Conform my Soul&mdash;as 'twere a Church, Unto Her Sacrament&mdash;

Emily Dickinson






Myself was formed&mdash;a Carpenter&mdash; An unpretending time

My Plane&mdash;and I, together wrought Before a Builder came&mdash;

To measure our attainments&mdash;

Sufficiently developed&mdash;He'd hire us At Halves&mdash;

My Tools took Human&mdash;Faces&mdash; The Bench, where we had toiled&mdash; Against the Man&mdash;persuaded&mdash; We&mdash;Temples build&mdash;I said&mdash; Emily Dickinson

Nature and God&mdash;I neither knew Yet Both so well knew me

They startled, like Executors

Of My identity.

Yet Neither told&mdash;that I could learn&mdash; My Secret as secure

As Herschel's private interest

Or Mercury's affair&mdash;

Nature is what we see—

"Nature" is what we see—

The Hill—the Afternoon—

Squirrel—Eclipse—the Bumble bee—

Nay—Nature is Heaven—

Nature is what we hear—

The Bobolink—the Sea—

Thunder—the Cricket—

Nay—Nature is Harmony—

Nature is what we know—

Yet have no art to say—

So impotent Our Wisdom is

To her Simplicity.

Emily Dickinson





Nature rarer uses yellow

Nature rarer uses yellow

Than another hue;

Saves she all of that for sunsets,--

Prodigal of blue,

Spending scarlet like a woman,

Yellow she affords

Only scantly and selectly,

Like a lover's words.

Emily Dickinson





Nature the gentlest mother is

Nature the gentlest mother is,

Impatient of no child,

The feeblest of the waywardest.

Her admonition mild

In forest and the hill

By traveller be heard,

Restraining rampant squirrel

Or too impetuous bird.

How fair her conversation

A summer afternoon,

Her household her assembly;

And when the sun go down,

Her voice among the aisles

Incite the timid prayer

Of the minutest cricket,

The most unworthy flower.

When all the children sleep,

She turns as long away

As will suffice tolight her lamps,

Then bending from the sky

With infinite affection

An infiniter care,

Her golden finger on her lip,

Wills silence everywhere.

New feet within my garden go


New feet within my garden go&mdash; New fingers stir the sod&mdash;

A Troubadour upon the Elm

Betrays the solitude.

New children play upon the green&mdash; New Weary sleep below&mdash;

And still the pensive Spring returns&mdash; And still the punctual snow!

No Man can compass a Despair


No Man can compass a Despair&mdash; As round a Goalless Road

No faster than a Mile at once

The Traveller proceed&mdash;

Unconscious of the Width&mdash;

Unconscious that the Sun

Be setting on His progress&mdash;

So accurate the One

At estimating Pain&mdash;

Whose own&mdash;has just begun&mdash; His ignorance&mdash;the Angel

No matter&mdash;now&mdash;Sweet&mdash; But when I'm Earl&mdash;

Won't you wish you'd spoken

Trivial a Word&mdash;just&mdash; Trivial&mdash;a Smile&mdash;

But won't you wish you'd spared one

When I'm Earl?

I shan't need it&mdash;then&mdash; Crests&mdash;will do&mdash;

No Notice gave She, but a Change


No Notice gave She, but a Change&mdash; No Message, but a Sigh&mdash;

For Whom, the Time did not suffice

That She should specify.

She was not warm, though Summer shone

Nor scrupulous of cold

Though Rime by Rime, the steady Frost

Upon Her Bosom piled&mdash;

Of shrinking ways&mdash;she did not fright Though all the Village looked&mdash; But held Her gravity aloft&mdash;

And met the gaze&mdash;direct&mdash; And when adjusted like a Seed

In careful fitted Ground

Unto the Everlasting Spring

And hindered but a Mound

Her Warm return, if so she chose&mdash; And We&mdash;imploring drew&mdash; Removed our invitation by

As Some She never knew&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





No Other can reduce


No Other can reduce

Our mortal Consequence

Like the remembering it be nought

A Period from hence

But Contemplation for

Contemporaneous Nought

Our Single Competition

No Rack can torture me


No Rack can torture me&mdash;

There knits a bolder One&mdash;

You cannot prick with saw&mdash;

Nor pierce with Scimitar&mdash;

Two Bodies&mdash;therefore be&mdash; Bind One&mdash;The Other fly&mdash; The Eagle of his Nest

No easier divest&mdash;

And gain the Sky

Than mayest Thou&mdash;

Except Thyself may be

Thine Enemy&mdash;

Captivity is Consciousness&mdash;

So's Liberty.

Emily Dickinson





No Romance sold unto


No Romance sold unto

Could so enthrall a Man

As the perusal of

His Individual One&mdash;

'Tis Fiction's&mdash;When 'tis small enough To Credit&mdash;'Tisn't true!

Emily Dickinson





Nobody knows this little Rose


Nobody knows this little Rose&mdash; It might a pilgrim be

Did I not take it from the ways

And lift it up to thee.

Only a Bee will miss it&mdash;

Only a Butterfly,

Hastening from far journey&mdash;

On its breast to lie&mdash;

Only a Bird will wonder&mdash;

Only a Breeze will sigh&mdash;

Ah Little Rose&mdash;how easy

For such as thee to die!

Emily Dickinson





None can experience sting


None can experience sting

Who Bounty&mdash;have not known&mdash; The fact of Famine&mdash;could not be Except for Fact of Corn&mdash;

Not all die early, dying young


Not all die early, dying young&mdash; Maturity of Fate

Is consummated equally

In Ages, or a Night&mdash;

A Hoary Boy, I've known to drop

Whole statured&mdash;by the side

Of Junior of Fourscore&mdash;'twas Act Not Period&mdash;that died.

Emily Dickinson





Not in this world to see his face

Not in this world to see his face

Sounds long, until I read the place

Where this is said to be

But just the primer to a life

Unopened, rare, upon the shelf,

Clasped yet to him and me.

And yet, my primer suits me so

I would not choose a book to know

Than that, be sweeter wise;

Might some one else so learned be.

And leave me just my A B C,

Himself could have the skies.

Emily Dickinson






Not probable&mdash;The barest Chance&mdash; A smile too few&mdash;a word too much And far from Heaven as the Rest&mdash; The Soul so close on Paradise&mdash; What if the Bird from journey far&mdash; Confused by Sweets&mdash;as Mortals&mdash;are&mdash; Forget the secret of His wing

And perish&mdash;but a Bough between&mdash; Oh, Groping feet&mdash;

Oh Phantom Queen!

Emily Dickinson





Not probable—The barest Chance


Not probable—The barest Chance—

A smile too few—a word too much

And far from Heaven as the Rest—

And perish—but a Bough between—

Oh, Groping feet—

Emily Dickinson





Not that We did, shall be the test


Not that We did, shall be the test

When Act and Will are done

But what Our Lord infers We would

Had We diviner been&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Of all the souls that stand create

Of all the souls that stand create

I have elected one.

When sense from spirit files away,

And subterfuge is done;

When that which is and that which was

Apart, intrinsic, stand,

And this brief tragedy of flesh

Is shifted like a sand;

When figures show their royal front

And mists are carved sway,--

Behold the atom I Feferred

To all the lists of clay!

Emily Dickinson





Of all the Sounds despatched abroad


Of all the Sounds despatched abroad,

There's not a Charge to me

Like that old measure in the Boughs&mdash; That phraseless Melody&mdash;

The Wind does&mdash;working like a Hand, Whose fingers Comb the Sky&mdash;

Then quiver down&mdash;with tufts of Tune&mdash; Permitted Gods, and me&mdash;

Inheritance, it is, to us&mdash;

Beyond the Art to Earn&mdash;

Beyond the trait to take away

By Robber, since the Gain

Is gotten not of fingers&mdash;

And inner than the Bone&mdash;

Hid golden, for the whole of Days,

And even in the Urn,

I cannot vouch the merry Dust

Do not arise and play

In some odd fashion of its own,

Some quainter Holiday,

When Winds go round and round in Bands&mdash; And thrum upon the door,

And Birds take places, overhead,

To bear them Orchestra.

I crave Him grace of Summer Boughs,

If such an Outcast be&mdash;

Who never heard that fleshless Chant&mdash; Rise&mdash;solemn&mdash;on the Tree, As if some Caravan of Sound

Off Deserts, in the Sky,

Had parted Rank,

Then knit, and swept&mdash;

In Seamless Company&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Of Being is a Bird


Of Being is a Bird

The likest to the Down

An Easy Breeze do put afloat

The General Heavens&mdash;upon&mdash; It soars&mdash;and shifts&mdash;and whirls&mdash; And measures with the Clouds

In easy&mdash;even&mdash;dazzling pace&mdash; No different the Birds&mdash;

Except a Wake of Music

Accompany their feet&mdash;

As did the Down emit a Tune&mdash; For Ecstasy&mdash;of it

Emily Dickinson





Of Bronze&mdash;and Blaze


Of Bronze&mdash;and Blaze&mdash; The North&mdash;Tonight&mdash; So adequate&mdash;it forms&mdash; So preconcerted with itself&mdash; So distant&mdash;to alarms&mdash; And Unconcern so sovereign

To Universe, or me&mdash;

Infects my simple spirit

With Taints of Majesty&mdash;

Till I take vaster attitudes&mdash; And strut upon my stem&mdash;

Disdaining Men, and Oxygen,

For Arrogance of them&mdash;

My Splendors, are Menagerie&mdash; But their Completeless Show

Will entertain the Centuries

When I, am long ago,

An Island in dishonored Grass&mdash; Whom none but Beetles&mdash;know.

Of Consciousness, her awful Mate


Of Consciousness, her awful Mate

The Soul cannot be rid&mdash;

As easy the secreting her

Behind the Eyes of God.

The deepest hid is sighted first

And scant to Him the Crowd&mdash;

What triple Lenses burn upon

The Escapade from God&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Of Course&mdash;I prayed


Of Course&mdash;I prayed&mdash; And did God Care?

He cared as much as on the Air

A Bird&mdash;had stamped her foot&mdash; And cried "Give Me"&mdash; My Reason&mdash;Life&mdash;

I had not had&mdash;but for Yourself&mdash;

'Twere better Charity

To leave me in the Atom's Tomb&mdash; Merry, and Nought, and gay, and numb&mdash; Than this smart Misery.

Of nearness to her sundered Things


Of nearness to her sundered Things

The Soul has special times&mdash;

When Dimness&mdash;looks the Oddity&mdash; Distinctness&mdash;easy&mdash;seems&mdash; The Shapes we buried, dwell about,

Familiar, in the Rooms&mdash;

Untarnished by the Sepulchre,

The Mouldering Playmate comes&mdash; In just the Jacket that he wore&mdash; Long buttoned in the Mold

Since we&mdash;old mornings, Children&mdash;played&mdash; Divided&mdash;by a world&mdash; The Grave yields back her Robberies&mdash; The Years, our pilfered Things&mdash; Bright Knots of Apparitions

Salute us, with their wings&mdash; As we&mdash;it were&mdash;that perished&mdash; Themself&mdash;had just remained till we rejoin them&mdash; And 'twas they, and not ourself

That mourned.

Emily Dickinson





Of Silken Speech and Specious Shoe


Of Silken Speech and Specious Shoe

A Traitor is the Bee

His service to the newest Grace

Present continually

His Suit a chance

His Troth a Term

Protracted as the Breeze

Continual Ban propoundeth He

Continual Divorce.

Emily Dickinson





Of Tolling Bell I ask the cause?


Of Tolling Bell I ask the cause?

"A Soul has gone to Heaven"

I'm answered in a lonesome tone&mdash; Is Heaven then a Prison?

That Bells should ring till all should know A Soul had gone to Heaven

Would seem to me the more the way

A Good News should be given.

Emily Dickinson





Of Tribulation, these are They


Of Tribulation, these are They,

Denoted by the White&mdash;

The Spangled Gowns, a lesser Rank

Of Victors&mdash;designate&mdash; All these&mdash;did conquer&mdash; But the ones who overcame most times&mdash; Wear nothing commoner than Snow&mdash; No Ornament, but Palms&mdash;

Surrender&mdash;is a sort unknown&mdash; On this superior soil&mdash;

Defeat&mdash;an outgrown Anguish&mdash; Remembered, as the Mile

On such a night, or such a night


On such a night, or such a night,

Would anybody care

If such a little figure

Slipped quiet from its chair&mdash; So quiet&mdash;Oh how quiet,

That nobody might know

But that the little figure

Rocked softer&mdash;to and fro&mdash; On such a dawn, or such a dawn&mdash; Would anybody sigh

That such a little figure

Too sound asleep did lie

For Chanticleer to wake it&mdash;

Or stirring house below&mdash;

Or giddy bird in orchard&mdash;

Or early task to do?

There was a little figure plump

For every little knoll&mdash;

Busy needles, and spools of thread&mdash; And trudging feet from school&mdash; Playmates, and holidays, and nuts&mdash; And visions vast and small&mdash;

Strange that the feet so precious charged Should reach so small a goal!

Emily Dickinson





On that dear Frame the Years had worn


On that dear Frame the Years had worn

Yet precious as the House

In which We first experienced Light

The Witnessing, to Us&mdash;

Precious! It was conceiveless fair

As Hands the Grave had grimed

Should softly place within our own

Denying that they died.

Emily Dickinson





On this long storm the Rainbow rose


On this long storm the Rainbow rose&mdash; On this late Morn&mdash;the Sun&mdash; The clouds&mdash;like listless Elephants&mdash; Horizons&mdash;straggled down&mdash; The Birds rose smiling, in their nests&mdash; The gales&mdash;indeed&mdash;were done&mdash; Alas, how heedless were the eyes&mdash; On whom the summer shone!

The quiet nonchalance of death&mdash; No Daybreak&mdash;can bestir&mdash; The slow&mdash;Archangel's syllables Must awaken her!

Emily Dickinson





On this wondrous sea


On this wondrous sea

Sailing silently,

Ho! Pilot, ho!

Knowest thou the shore

Where no breakers roar&mdash;

Where the storm is o'er?

In the peaceful west

Many the sails at rest&mdash;

The anchors fast&mdash;

Thither I pilot thee&mdash;

Land Ho! Eternity!

Ashore at last!

Emily Dickinson





Once more, my now bewildered Dove


Once more, my now bewildered Dove

Bestirs her puzzled wings

Once more her mistress, on the deep

Her troubled question flings&mdash; Thrice to the floating casement

The Patriarch's bird returned,

Courage! My brave Columba!

There may yet be Land!

Emily Dickinson





One and One&mdash;are One

One Anguish&mdash;in a Crowd


One Anguish&mdash;in a Crowd&mdash; A Minor thing&mdash;it sounds&mdash; And yet, unto the single Doe

Attempted of the Hounds

'Tis Terror as consummate

As Legions of Alarm

Did leap, full flanked, upon the Host&mdash;

'Tis Units&mdash;make the Swarm&mdash; A Small Leech&mdash;on the Vitals&mdash; The sliver, in the Lung&mdash;

The Bung out&mdash;of an Artery&mdash; Are scarce accounted&mdash;Harms&mdash; Yet might&mdash;by relation

To that Repealless thing&mdash;

A Being&mdash;impotent to end&mdash; When once it has begun&mdash;

One Blessing had I than the rest


One Blessing had I than the rest

So larger to my Eyes

That I stopped gauging&mdash;satisfied&mdash; For this enchanted size&mdash;

It was the limit of my Dream&mdash; The focus of my Prayer&mdash;

A perfect&mdash;paralyzing Bliss&mdash; Contented as Despair&mdash;

I knew no more of Want&mdash;or Cold&mdash; Phantasms both become

For this new Value in the Soul&mdash; Supremest Earthly Sum&mdash;

The Heaven below the Heaven above&mdash; Obscured with ruddier Blue&mdash;

Life's Latitudes leant over&mdash;full&mdash; The Judgment perished&mdash;too&mdash; Why Bliss so scantily disburse&mdash; Why Paradise defer&mdash;

Why Floods be served to Us&mdash;in Bowls&mdash; I speculate no more&mdash;

One Crucifixion is recorded&mdash;only&mdash; How many be

One Day is there of the Series


One Day is there of the Series

Termed Thanksgiving Day.

Celebrated part at Table

Part in Memory.

Neither Patriarch nor Pussy

I dissect the Play

Seems it to my Hooded thinking

Reflex Holiday.

Had there been no sharp Subtraction

From the early Sum&mdash;

Not an Acre or a Caption

Where was once a Room&mdash;

Not a Mention, whose small Pebble

Wrinkled any Sea,

Unto Such, were such Assembly

'Twere Thanksgiving Day.

Emily Dickinson





One dignity delays for all


One dignity delays for all&mdash;

One mitred Afternoon&mdash;

None can avoid this purple&mdash;

None evade this Crown!

Coach, it insures, and footmen&mdash; Chamber, and state, and throng&mdash; Bells, also, in the village

As we ride grand along!

What dignified Attendants!

What service when we pause!

How loyally at parting

Their hundred hats they raise!

Her pomp surpassing ermine

When simple You, and I,

Present our meek escutheon

And claim the rank to die!

Emily Dickinson





One Life of so much Consequence!


One Life of so much Consequence!

Yet I&mdash;for it&mdash;would pay&mdash; My Soul's entire income&mdash;

In ceaseless&mdash;salary&mdash; One Pearl&mdash;to me&mdash;so signal&mdash; That I would instant dive&mdash;

Although&mdash;I knew&mdash;to take it&mdash; Would cost me&mdash;just a life!

The Sea is full&mdash;I know it!

That&mdash;does not blur my Gem!

It burns&mdash;distinct from all the row&mdash; Intact&mdash;in Diadem!

The life is thick&mdash;I know it!

Yet&mdash;not so dense a crowd&mdash; But Monarchs&mdash;are perceptible&mdash; Far down the dustiest Road!

Emily Dickinson





One need not be a chamber to be haunted, One need not be a chamber to be haunted, One need not be a house;

The brain has corridors surpassing

Material place.

Far safer, of a midnight meeting

External ghost,

Than an interior confronting

That whiter host.

Far safer through an Abbey gallop,

The stones achase,

Than, moonless, one's own self encounter In lonesome place.

Ourself, behind ourself concealed,

Should startle most;

Assassin, hid in our apartment,

Be horror's least.

The prudent carries a revolver,

He bolts the door,

O'erlooking a superior spectre

More near.

Emily Dickinson






One need not be a Chamber&mdash;to be Haunted&mdash; One need not be a House&mdash;

The Brain has Corridors&mdash;surpassing Material Place&mdash;

Far safer, through an Abbey gallop,

The Stones a'chase&mdash;

Than Unarmed, one's a'self encounter&mdash; In lonesome Place&mdash;

Ourself behind ourself, concealed&mdash; Should startle most&mdash;

Be Horror's least.

One Sister have I in our house


One Sister have I in our house,

And one, a hedge away.

There's only one recorded,

But both belong to me.

One came the road that I came&mdash; And wore my last year's gown&mdash; The other, as a bird her nest,

Builded our hearts among.

She did not sing as we did&mdash;

It was a different tune&mdash;

Herself to her a music

As Bumble bee of June.

Today is far from Childhood&mdash; But up and down the hills

I held her hand the tighter&mdash; Which shortened all the miles&mdash; And still her hum

The years among,

Deceives the Butterfly;

Still in her Eye

The Violets lie

Mouldered this many May.

I spilt the dew&mdash;

But took the morn&mdash;

I chose this single star

From out the wide night's numbers&mdash; Sue - forevermore!

Emily Dickinson

Madonna dim, to whom all Feet may come, Regard a Nun&mdash;

Our journey had advanced;

Our journey had advanced;

Our feet were almost come

To that odd fork in Being's road,

Eternity by term.

Our pace took sudden awe,

Our feet reluctant led.

Before were cities, but between,

The forest of the dead.

Retreat was out of hope,--

Behind, a sealed route,

Eternity's white flag before,

And God at every gate.

Emily Dickinson






Our little Kinsmen&mdash;after Rain In plenty may be seen,

A Pink and Pulpy multitude

The tepid Ground upon.

A needless life, it seemed to me

Until a little Bird

As to a Hospitality

Advanced and breakfasted.

As I of He, so God of Me

I pondered, may have judged,

And left the little Angle Worm

With Modesties enlarged.

Our Lives Are Swiss

Our lives are Swiss --

So still -- so Cool --

Till some odd afternoon

The Alps neglect their Curtains

And we look farther on!

Italy stands the other side!

While like a guard between --

The solemn Alps --

The siren Alps

Forever intervene!

Our share of night to bear


Our share of night to bear&mdash;

Ourselves were wed one summer&mdash;dear&mdash; Your Vision&mdash;was in June&mdash; And when Your little Lifetime failed,

I wearied&mdash;too&mdash;of mine&mdash; And overtaken in the Dark&mdash;

Over and over, like a Tune


Over and over, like a Tune&mdash;

The Recollection plays&mdash;

Drums off the Phantom Battlements

Cornets of Paradise&mdash;

Snatches, from Baptized Generations&mdash; Cadences too grand

But for the Justified Processions

At the Lord's Right hand.

Over the fence


Over the fence&mdash;

Strawberries&mdash;grow&mdash; Over the fence&mdash;

I could climb&mdash;if I tried, I know&mdash; Berries are nice!

Oh, dear,&mdash;I guess if He were a Boy&mdash; He'd&mdash;climb&mdash;if He could!

Pain

Pain--has an Element of Blank--

Perhaps I Asked Too Large

Perhaps I asked too large --

I take -- no less than skies --

For Earths, grow thick as

Berries, in my native town --

My Basked holds -- just -- Firmaments --

Those -- dangle easy -- on my arm,

But smaller bundles -- Cram.

Perhaps you think me stooping


Perhaps you think me stooping

I'm not ashamed of that

Christ&mdash;stooped until He touched the Grave&mdash; Do those at Sacrament

Commemorative Dishonor

Or love annealed of love

Until it bend as low as Death

Redignified, above?

Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower


Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower,

But I could never sell&mdash;

If you would like to borrow,

Until the Daffodil

Unties her yellow Bonnet

Beneath the village door,

Until the Bees, from Clover rows

Their Hock, and Sherry, draw,

Why, I will lend until just then,

But not an hour more!

Venice could not show a check

Of a tint so lustrous meek&mdash;

Never such an Ambuscade

As of briar and leaf displayed

For my little damask maid&mdash;

I had rather wear her grace

Than an Earl's distinguished face&mdash; I had rather dwell like her

Than be "Duke of Exeter"&mdash; Royalty enough for me

To subdue the Bumblebee.

Did they forget thee?

Then dinna care! Then dinna care!

Put up my lute!


Put up my lute!

What of&mdash;my Music!

Since the sole ear I cared to charm&mdash; Passive&mdash;as Granite&mdash;laps My Music&mdash; Sobbing&mdash;will suit&mdash;as well as psalm!

Would but the "Memnon" of the Desert&mdash; Teach me the strain

That vanquished Him&mdash;

When He&mdash;surrendered to the Sunrise&mdash; Maybe&mdash;that&mdash;would awaken&mdash;them!

Read&mdash;Sweet&mdash;how others&mdash;strove&mdash; Till we&mdash;are stouter&mdash; What they&mdash;renounced&mdash; Till we&mdash;are less afraid&mdash; How many times they&mdash;bore the faithful witness&mdash; Till we&mdash;are helped&mdash; As if a Kingdom&mdash;cared!

Read then&mdash;of faith&mdash; That shone above the fagot&mdash;

Clear strains of Hymn

The River could not drown&mdash;

Brave names of Men&mdash;

And Celestial Women&mdash;

Passed out&mdash;of Record

Into&mdash;Renown!

Rehearsal to Ourselves


Rehearsal to Ourselves

Of a Withdrawn Delight&mdash;

Affords a Bliss like Murder&mdash; Omnipotent&mdash;Acute&mdash;

We will not drop the Dirk&mdash;

Because We love the Wound

The Dirk Commemorate&mdash;Itself

Remind Us that we died.

Remorse

Remorse -- is Memory -- awake --

Her Parties all astir --

A Presence of Departed Acts --

At window -- and at Door --

Its Past -- set down before the Soul

And lighted with a Match --

Perusal -- to facilitate --

And help Belief to stretch --

Remorse is cureless -- the Disease

Not even God -- can heal --

For 'tis His institution -- and

The Adequate of Hell --

Removed from Accident of Loss


Removed from Accident of Loss

By Accident of Gain

Befalling not my simple Days&mdash; Myself had just to earn&mdash;

Of Riches&mdash;as unconscious

As is the Brown Malay

Of Pearls in Eastern Waters,

Marked His&mdash;What Holiday

Would stir his slow conception&mdash; Had he the power to dream

That put the Dower's fraction&mdash; Awaited even&mdash;Him&mdash;

Renunciation

Renunciation -- is a piercing Virtue --

The letting go

A Presence -- for an Expectation --

Not now --

The putting out of Eyes --

Just Sunrise --

Lest Day --

Day's Great Progenitor --

Outvie

Renunciation -- is the Choosing

Against itself --

Itself to justify

Unto itself --

When larger function --

Make that appear --

Smaller -- that Covered Vision -- Here --

Ribbons of the Year

Safe in Their Alabaster Chambers

Safe in their Alabaster Chambers --

Untouched by Morning

And untouched by Noon --

Sleep the meek members of the Resurrection --

Rafter of satin,

And Roof of stone.

Light laughs the breeze

In her Castle above them --

Babbles the Bee in a stolid Ear,

Pipe the Sweet Birds in ignorant cadence --

Ah, what sagacity perished here!

Emily Dickinson





Safe in their alabaster chambers,

Safe in their alabaster chambers,

Untouched by morning and untouched by noon, Sleep the meek members of the resurrection, Rafter of satin, and roof of stone.

Light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine; Babbles the bee in a stolid ear;

Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadences, --

Ah, what sagacity perished here!

Grand go the years in the crescent above them; Worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row, Diadems drop and Doges surrender,

Soundless as dots on a disk of snow.

Emily Dickinson





Savior! I've no one else to tell


Savior! I've no one else to tell&mdash; And so I trouble thee.

I am the one forgot thee so&mdash; Dost thou remember me?

Nor, for myself, I came so far&mdash; That were the little load&mdash;

I brought thee the imperial Heart

I had not strength to hold&mdash;

The Heart I carried in my own&mdash; Till mine too heavy grew&mdash;

Yet&mdash;strangest&mdash;heavier since it went&mdash; Is it too large for you?

Emily Dickinson





Severer Service of myself


Severer Service of myself

I&mdash;hastened to demand

To fill the awful Vacuum

Your life had left behind&mdash;

I worried Nature with my Wheels

When Hers had ceased to run&mdash; When she had put away Her Work

My own had just begun.

I strove to weary Brain and Bone&mdash; To harass to fatigue

The glittering Retinue of nerves&mdash; Vitality to clog

To some dull comfort Those obtain

Who put a Head away

They knew the Hair to&mdash;

And forget the color of the Day&mdash; Affliction would not be appeased&mdash; The Darkness braced as firm

As all my stratagem had been

The Midnight to confirm&mdash;

No Drug for Consciousness&mdash;can be&mdash; Alternative to die

Is Nature's only Pharmacy

For Being's Malady&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Sexton! My Master's sleeping here


Sexton! My Master's sleeping here.

Pray lead me to his bed!

I came to build the Bird's nest,

And sow the Early seed&mdash;

That when the snow creeps slowly

From off his chamber door&mdash;

Daisies point the way there&mdash; And the Troubadour.

Emily Dickinson





She bore it till the simple veins


She bore it till the simple veins

Traced azure on her hand&mdash;

Til pleading, round her quiet eyes

The purple Crayons stand.

Till Daffodils had come and gone

I cannot tell the sum,

And then she ceased to bear it&mdash; And with the Saints sat down.

No more her patient figure

At twilight soft to meet&mdash;

No more her timid bonnet

Upon the village street&mdash;

But Crowns instead, and Courtiers&mdash; And in the midst so fair,

Whose but her shy&mdash;immortal face Of whom we're whispering here?

Emily Dickinson






She dealt her pretty words like Blades&mdash; How glittering they shone&mdash;

And every One unbared a Nerve

Or wantoned with a Bone&mdash;

She never deemed&mdash;she hurt&mdash; That&mdash;is not Steel's Affair&mdash; A vulgar grimace in the Flesh&mdash; How ill the Creatures bear&mdash;

To Ache is human&mdash;not polite&mdash; The Film upon the eye

Mortality's old Custom&mdash;

Just locking up&mdash;to Die.

Emily Dickinson





She died at play


She died at play,

Gambolled away

Her lease of spotted hours,

Then sank as gaily as a Turn

Upon a Couch of flowers.

Her ghost strolled softly o'er the hill Yesterday, and Today,

Her vestments as the silver fleece&mdash; Her countenance as spray.

Emily Dickinson






She died&mdash;this was the way she died.

And when her breath was done

Took up her simple wardrobe

And started for the sun.

Her little figure at the gate

The Angels must have spied,

Since I could never find her

Upon the mortal side.

Emily Dickinson





She died—this was the way she died

She dwelleth in the Ground


She dwelleth in the Ground&mdash;

Where Daffodils&mdash;abide&mdash; Her Maker&mdash;Her Metropolis&mdash; The Universe&mdash;Her Maid&mdash; To fetch Her Grace&mdash;and Hue&mdash; And Fairness&mdash;and Renown&mdash; The Firmament's&mdash;To Pluck Her&mdash; And fetch Her Thee&mdash;be mine&mdash; Emily Dickinson





She hideth Her the last


She hideth Her the last&mdash;

And is the first, to rise&mdash;

Her Night doth hardly recompense

The Closing of Her eyes&mdash;

She doth Her Purple Work&mdash;

And putteth Her away

In low Apartments in the Sod -

As worthily as We.

To imitate her life

As impotent would be

As make of Our imperfect Mints,

The Julep&mdash;of the Bee&mdash; Emily Dickinson





She lay as if at play


She lay as if at play

Her life had leaped away&mdash;

Intending to return&mdash;

But not so soon&mdash;

Her merry Arms, half dropt&mdash;

As if for lull of sport&mdash;

An instant had forgot&mdash;

The Trick to start&mdash;

Her dancing Eyes&mdash;ajar&mdash; As if their Owner were

Still sparkling through

For fun&mdash;at you&mdash;

Her Morning at the door&mdash;

Devising, I am sure&mdash;

To force her sleep&mdash;

So light&mdash;so deep&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





She rose to His Requirement


She rose to His Requirement&mdash;dropt The Playthings of Her Life

To take the honorable Work

Of Woman, and of Wife&mdash;

If ought She missed in Her new Day,

Of Amplitude, or Awe&mdash;

Or first Prospective&mdash;Or the Gold In using, wear away,

It lay unmentioned&mdash;as the Sea Develop Pearl, and Weed,

But only to Himself&mdash;be known The Fathoms they abide&mdash;

She rose to His Requirement - dropt

The playthings of her Life

To take the honorable Work

Or first Prospective - Or the Gold

In using, wear away,

She rose to his requirement, dropped

She rose to his requirement, dropped

The playthings of her life

To take the honorable work

Of woman and of wife.

If aught she missed in her new day

Of amplitude, or awe,

Or first prospective, or the gold

In using wore away,

It lay unmentioned, as the sea

Develops pearl and weed,

But only to himself is known

The fathoms they abide.

She sights a Bird&mdash;she chuckles&mdash; She flattens&mdash;then she crawls&mdash; She runs without the look of feet&mdash; Her eyes increase to Balls&mdash;

Her Jaws stir&mdash;twitching&mdash;hungry&mdash; Her Teeth can hardly stand&mdash;

She leaps, but Robin leaped the first&mdash; Ah, Pussy, of the Sand,

The Hopes so juicy ripening&mdash; You almost bather your Tongue&mdash; When Bliss disclosed a hundred Toes&mdash; And fled with every one&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





She sights a Bird—she chuckles


She sights a Bird—she chuckles—

She flattens—then she crawls—

She runs without the look of feet—

Her eyes increase to Balls—

Her Jaws stir—twitching—hungry—

Her Teeth can hardly stand—

She leaps, but Robin leaped the first—

Ah, Pussy, of the Sand,

The Hopes so juicy ripening—

You almost bather your Tongue—

When Bliss disclosed a hundred Toes—

And fled with every one—

Emily Dickinson





She slept beneath a tree


She slept beneath a tree&mdash;

Remembered but by me.

I touched her Cradle mute&mdash;

She recognized the foot&mdash;

Put on her carmine suit

And see!

Emily Dickinson





She sped as Petals of a Rose


She sped as Petals of a Rose

Offended by the Wind&mdash;

A frail Aristocrat of Time

Indemnity to find&mdash;

Leaving on nature&mdash;a Default

As Cricket or as Bee&mdash;

But Andes in the Bosoms where

She had begun to lie&mdash;

Emily Dickinson






She staked her Feathers&mdash;Gained an Arc&mdash; Debated&mdash;Rose again&mdash; This time&mdash;beyond the estimate Of Envy, or of Men&mdash;

And now, among Circumference&mdash; Her steady Boat be seen&mdash;

At home&mdash;among the Billows&mdash;As The Bough where she was born&mdash; Emily Dickinson





She staked her Feathers—Gained an Arc


She staked her Feathers—Gained an Arc—

Debated—Rose again—

She sweeps with many-colored Brooms


She sweeps with many-colored Brooms&mdash; And leaves the Shreds behind&mdash; Oh Housewife in the Evening West&mdash; Come back, and dust the Pond!

You dropped a Purple Ravelling in&mdash; You dropped an Amber thread&mdash; And how you've littered all the East

With duds of Emerald!

And still, she plies her spotted Brooms, And still the Aprons fly,

Till Brooms fade softly into stars&mdash; And then I come away&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





She sweeps with many-colored brooms,

She sweeps with many-colored brooms,

And leaves the shreds behind;

Oh, housewife in the evening west,

Come back, and dust the pond!

You dropped a purple ravelling in,

You dropped an amber thread;

And now you've littered all the East

With duds of emerald!

And still she plies her spotted brooms, And still the aprons fly,

Till brooms fade softly into stars --

And then I come away.

Emily Dickinson





She went as quiet as the Dew


She went as quiet as the Dew

From an Accustomed flower.

Not like the Dew, did she return

At the Accustomed hour!

She dropt as softly as a star

From out my summer's Eve&mdash;

Less skillful than Le Verriere

It's sorer to believe!

Emily Dickinson





Shells from the Coast mistaking


Shells from the Coast mistaking&mdash; I cherished them for All&mdash;

Happening in After Ages

To entertain a Pearl&mdash;

Wherefore so late&mdash;I murmured&mdash; My need of Thee&mdash;be done&mdash; Therefore&mdash;the Pearl responded&mdash; My Period begin

Emily Dickinson





She's happy, with a new Content


She's happy, with a new Content&mdash; That feels to her&mdash;like Sacrament&mdash; She's busy&mdash;with an altered Care&mdash; As just apprenticed to the Air&mdash; She's tearful&mdash;if she weep at all&mdash; For blissful Causes&mdash;Most of all That Heaven permit so meek as her&mdash; To such a Fate&mdash;to Minister.

Should you but fail at&mdash;Sea


Should you but fail at&mdash;Sea&mdash; In sight of me&mdash;

Or doomed lie&mdash;

Next Sun&mdash;to die&mdash;

Or rap&mdash;at Paradise&mdash;unheard I'd harass God

Until he let you in!

Emily Dickinson





Should you but fail at—Sea

In sight of me—

Or doomed lie—

Next Sun—to die—

Or rap—at Paradise—unheard

I'd harass God

Until he let you in!

Sic transit gloria mundi


"Sic transit gloria mundi,"

"How doth the busy bee,"

"Dum vivimus vivamus,"

I stay mine enemy!

Oh "veni, vidi, vici!"

Oh caput cap-a-pie!

And oh "memento mori"

When I am far from thee!

Hurrah for Peter Parley!

Hurrah for Daniel Boone!

Three cheers, sir, for the gentleman

Who first observed the moon!

Peter, put up the sunshine;

Patti, arrange the stars;

Tell Luna, tea is waiting,

And call your brother Mars!

Put down the apple, Adam,

And come away with me,

So shalt thou have a pippin

From off my father's tree!

I climb the "Hill of Science,"

I "view the landscape o'er;"

Such transcendental prospect,

I ne'er beheld before!

Unto the Legislature

My country bids me go;

I'll take my india rubbers,

In case the wind should blow!

During my education,

It was announced to me

That gravitation, stumbling,

Fell from an apple tree!

The earth upon an axis

Was once supposed to turn,

By way of a gymnastic

In honor of the sun!

It was the brave Columbus,

A sailing o'er the tide,

Who notified the nations

Of where I would reside!





Mortality is fatal&mdash;

Gentility is fine,

Rascality, heroic,

Insolvency, sublime!

Our Fathers being weary,

Laid down on Bunker Hill;

And tho' full many a morning,

Yet they are sleeping still,&mdash; The trumpet, sir, shall wake them,

In dreams I see them rise,

Each with a solemn musket

A marching to the skies!

A coward will remain, Sir,

Until the fight is done;

But an immortal hero

Will take his hat, and run!

Good bye, Sir, I am going;

My country calleth me;

Allow me, Sir, at parting,

To wipe my weeping e'e.

In token of our friendship

Accept this "Bonnie Doon,"

And when the hand that plucked it

Hath passed beyond the moon,

The memory of my ashes

Will consolation be;

Then, farewell, Tuscarora,

And farewell, Sir, to thee!

Emily Dickinson






Size circumscribes&mdash;it has no room For petty furniture&mdash;

The Giant tolerates no Gnat

For Ease of Gianture&mdash;

Repudiates it, all the more&mdash; Because intrinsic size

Ignores the possibility

Of Calumnies&mdash;or Flies.

Emily Dickinson

Sleep is supposed to be


Sleep is supposed to be

By souls of sanity

The shutting of the eye.

Sleep is the station grand

Down which, on either hand

The hosts of witness stand!

Morn is supposed to be

By people of degree

The breaking of the Day.

Morning has not occurred!

That shall Aurora be&mdash;

East of Eternity&mdash;

One with the banner gay&mdash;

One in the red array&mdash;

That is the break of Day!

Emily Dickinson





Smiling back from Coronation


Smiling back from Coronation

May be Luxury&mdash;

On the Heads that started with us&mdash; Being's Peasantry&mdash;

Recognizing in Procession

Ones We former knew&mdash;

When Ourselves were also dusty&mdash; Centuries ago&mdash;

Had the Triumph no Conviction

Of how many be&mdash;

Stimulated&mdash;by the Contrast&mdash; Unto Misery&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Snow beneath whose chilly softness


Snow beneath whose chilly softness

Some that never lay

Make their first Repose this Winter

I admonish Thee

Blanket Wealthier the Neighbor

We so new bestow

Than thine acclimated Creature

Wilt Thou, Austere Snow?

Emily Dickinson





Snow flakes


Snow flakes.

I counted till they danced so

Their slippers leaped the town,

And then I took a pencil

To note the rebels down.

And then they grew so jolly

I did resign the prig,

And ten of my once stately toes

Are marshalled for a jig!

Emily Dickinson





So bashful when I spied her!


So bashful when I spied her!

So pretty&mdash;so ashamed!

So hidden in her leaflets

Lest anybody find&mdash;

So breathless till I passed here&mdash; So helpless when I turned

And bore her struggling, blushing,

Her simple haunts beyond!

For whom I robbed the Dingle&mdash; For whom I betrayed the Dell&mdash; Many, will doubtless ask me,

But I shall never tell!

Emily Dickinson





So bashful when I spied her,

So bashful when I spied her,

So pretty, so ashmed!

So hidden in her leaflets,

Lest anybody find;

So breathless till I passed her,

So helpless when I turned

And bore her, struggling, blushing,

Her simple haunts beyond!

For whom I robbed the dingle,

For whom betrayed the dell,

Many will doubtless ask me,

But I shall never tell!

Emily Dickinson





So from the mould


So from the mould

Scarlet and Gold

Many a Bulb will rise&mdash;

Hidden away, cunningly, From sagacious eyes.

So from Cocoon

Many a Worm

Leap so Highland gay,

Peasants like me,

Peasants like Thee

Gaze perplexedly!

Emily Dickinson






So glad we are&mdash;a Stranger'd deem

'Twas sorry, that we were&mdash;

For where the Holiday should be

There publishes a Tear&mdash;

Nor how Ourselves be justified&mdash; Since Grief and Joy are done

So similar&mdash;An Optizan

Could not decide between&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





So glad we are—a Stranger'd deem

So has a Daisy vanished


So has a Daisy vanished

From the fields today&mdash;

So tiptoed many a slipper

To Paradise away&mdash;

Oozed so in crimson bubbles

Day's departing tide&mdash;

Blooming&mdash;tripping&mdash;flowing Are ye then with God?

Emily Dickinson





So much Summer


So much Summer

Me for showing

Illegitimate&mdash;

Would a Smile's minute bestowing

Too exorbitant

To the Lady

With the Guinea

Look&mdash;if She should know

Crumb of Mine

A Robin's Larder

Would suffice to stow&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





So proud she was to die

So proud she was to die

It made us all ashamed

That what we cherished, so unknown

To her desire seemed.

So satisfied to go

Where none of us should be,

Immediately, that anguish stooped

Almost to jealousy.

Emily Dickinson





So set its Sun in Thee


So set its Sun in Thee

What Day be dark to me&mdash;

What Distance&mdash;far&mdash; So I the Ships may see

That touch&mdash;how seldomly&mdash; Thy Shore?

Emily Dickinson






So the Eyes accost&mdash;and sunder In an Audience&mdash;

Stamped&mdash;occasionally&mdash;forever&mdash; So may Countenance

Entertain&mdash;without addressing Countenance of One

In a Neighboring Horizon&mdash;

Gone&mdash;as soon as known&mdash; Emily Dickinson





So the Eyes accost—and sunder

In an Audience—

Stamped—occasionally—forever—

Emily Dickinson





So well that I can live without


So well that I can live without&mdash; I love thee&mdash;then How well is that?

As well as Jesus?

Prove it me

That He&mdash;loved Men&mdash; As I&mdash;love thee&mdash;

Some Keep the Sabbath Going to Church

Some keep the Sabbath going to Church --

I keep it, staying at Home --

With a Bobolink for a Chorister --

And an Orchard, for a Dome --

Some keep the Sabbath in Surplice --

I just wear my Wings --

And instead of tolling the Bell, for Church, Our little Sexton -- sings.

God preaches, a noted Clergyman --

And the sermon is never long,

So instead of getting to Heaven, at least --

I'm going, all along.

Emily Dickinson





Some Rainbow&mdash;coming from the Fair!


Some Rainbow&mdash;coming from the Fair!

Some Vision of the World Cashmere&mdash; I confidently see!

Or else a Peacock's purple Train

Feather by feather&mdash;on the plain Fritters itself away!

The dreamy Butterflies bestir!

Lethargic pools resume the whir

Of last year's sundered tune!

From some old Fortress on the sun

Baronial Bees&mdash;march&mdash;one by one&mdash; In murmuring platoon!

The Robins stand as thick today

As flakes of snow stood yesterday&mdash; On fence&mdash;and Roof&mdash;and Twig!

The Orchis binds her feather on

For her old lover - Don the Sun!

Revisiting the Bog!

Without Commander! Countless! Still!

The Regiments of Wood and Hill

In bright detachment stand!

Behold! Whose Multitudes are these?

The children of whose turbaned seas&mdash; Or what Circassian Land?

Emily Dickinson

The children of whose turbaned seas—

Or what Circassian Land?

Some such Butterfly be seen


Some such Butterfly be seen

On Brazilian Pampas&mdash;

Just at noon&mdash;no later&mdash;Sweet&mdash; Then&mdash;the License closes&mdash; Some such Spice&mdash;express and pass&mdash; Subject to Your Plucking&mdash;

As the Stars&mdash;You knew last Night&mdash; Foreigners&mdash;This Morning&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Some things that fly there be


Some things that fly there be&mdash; Birds&mdash;Hours&mdash;the Bumblebee&mdash; Of these no Elegy.

Some things that stay there be&mdash; Grief&mdash;Hills&mdash;Eternity&mdash; Nor this behooveth me.

There are that resting, rise.

Can I expound the skies?

How still the Riddle lies!

Some&mdash;Work for Immortality


Some&mdash;Work for Immortality&mdash; The Chiefer part, for Time&mdash;

He&mdash;Compensates&mdash;immediately&mdash; The former&mdash;Checks&mdash;on Fame&mdash; Slow Gold&mdash;but Everlasting&mdash; The Bullion of Today&mdash;

Contrasted with the Currency

Of Immortality&mdash;

A Beggar&mdash;Here and There&mdash; Is gifted to discern

Beyond the Broker's insight&mdash; One's&mdash;Money&mdash;One's&mdash;the Mine&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Some, too fragile for winter winds


Some, too fragile for winter winds

The thoughtful grave encloses&mdash; Tenderly tucking them in from frost

Before their feet are cold.

Never the treasures in her nest

The cautious grave exposes,

Building where schoolboy dare not look, And sportsman is not bold.

This covert have all the children

Early aged, and often cold,

Sparrow, unnoticed by the Father&mdash; Lambs for whom time had not a fold.

Emily Dickinson





Some—Work for Immortality

Contrasted with the Currency

A Beggar—Here and There—

Soto! Explore thyself!


Soto! Explore thyself!

Therein thyself shalt find

The "Undiscovered Continent"&mdash; No Settler had the Mind.

Emily Dickinson





Soul, Wilt thou toss again?


Soul, Wilt thou toss again?

By just such a hazard

Hundreds have lost indeed&mdash;

But tens have won an all&mdash;

Angel's breathless ballot

Lingers to record thee&mdash;

Imps in eager Caucus

Raffle for my Soul!

Emily Dickinson





South Winds jostle them


South Winds jostle them&mdash;

Bumblebees come&mdash;

Hover&mdash;hesitate&mdash;

Drink, and are gone&mdash;

Butterflies pause

On their passage Cashmere&mdash;

I&mdash;softly plucking,

Present them here!

Emily Dickinson





Sown in dishonor


"Sown in dishonor"!

Ah! Indeed!

May this "dishonor" be?

If I were half so fine myself

I'd notice nobody!

"Sown in corruption"!

Not so fast!

Apostle is askew!


A Circumstance or two!

Emily Dickinson





Speech—is a prank of Parliament—

"Speech"—is a prank of Parliament—

"Tears"—is a trick of the nerve—

But the Heart with the heaviest freight on—

Doesn't—always—move—

Split the Lark

Split the Lark -- and you'll find the Music --

Bulb after Bulb, in Silver rolled --

Scantilly dealt to the Summer Morning

Saved for your Ear when Lutes be old.

Loose the Flood -- you shall find it patent --

Gush after Gush, reserved for you --

Scarlet Experiment! Sceptic Thomas!

Now, do you doubt that your Bird was true?

Spring is the Period


Spring is the Period

Express from God.

Among the other seasons

Himself abide,

But during March and April

None stir abroad

Without a cordial interview

With God.

Strong Draughts of Their Refreshing Minds To drink&mdash;enables Mine

Through Desert or the Wilderness

As bore it Sealed Wine&mdash;

To go elastic&mdash;Or as One

The Camel's trait&mdash;attained&mdash; How powerful the Stimulus

Of an Hermetic Mind&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Struck, was I, not yet by Lightning


Struck, was I, not yet by Lightning&mdash; Lightning&mdash;lets away

Power to perceive His Process

With Vitality.

Maimed&mdash;was I&mdash;yet not by Venture&mdash; Stone of stolid Boy&mdash;

Nor a Sportsman's Peradventure&mdash; Who mine Enemy?

Robbed&mdash;was I&mdash;intact to Bandit&mdash; All my Mansion torn&mdash;

Sun&mdash;withdrawn to Recognition&mdash; Furthest shining&mdash;done&mdash; Yet was not the foe&mdash;of any&mdash; Not the smallest Bird

In the nearest Orchard dwelling

Be of Me&mdash;afraid.

Most&mdash;I love the Cause that slew Me.

Often as I die

Its beloved Recognition

Holds a Sun on Me&mdash;

Best&mdash;at Setting&mdash;as is Nature's&mdash; Neither witnessed Rise

Till the infinite Aurora

In the other's eyes.

Emily Dickinson





Success is Counted Sweetest

Success is counted sweetest

By those who ne'er succeed.

To comprehend a nectar

Requires sorest need.

Not one of all the purple Host

Who took the Flag today

Can tell the definition

So clear of Victory

As he defeated--dying--

On whose forbidden ear

The distant strains of triumph

Burst agonized and clear!

Emily Dickinson





Such is the Force of Happiness


Such is the Force of Happiness&mdash; The Least&mdash;can lift a Ton

Assisted by its stimulus&mdash;

Who Misery&mdash;sustain&mdash; No Sinew can afford&mdash;

The Cargo of Themselves&mdash;

Too infinite for Consciousness'

Slow capabilities.

Emily Dickinson





Summer for thee, grant I may be


Summer for thee, grant I may be

When Summer days are flown!

Thy music still, when Whipporwill

And Oriole&mdash;are done!

For thee to bloom, I'll skip the tomb

And row my blossoms o'er!

Pray gather me&mdash;

Anemone&mdash;

Thy flower&mdash;forevermore!

Emily Dickinson





Summer Shower

A drop fell on the apple tree,

Another on the roof;

A half a dozen kissed the eaves,

And made the gables laugh.

A few went out to help the brook,

That went to help the sea.

Myself conjectured, Were they pearls,

What necklaces could be!

The dust replaced in hoisted roads,

The birds jocoser sung;

The sunshine threw his hat away,

The orchards spangles hung.

The breezes brought dejected lutes,

And bathed them in the glee;

The East put out a single flag,

And signed the fete away.

Emily Dickinson





Sunset at Night&mdash;is natural


Sunset at Night&mdash;is natural&mdash; But Sunset on the Dawn

Reverses Nature&mdash;Master&mdash; So Midnight's&mdash;due&mdash;at Noon.

Eclipses be&mdash;predicted&mdash; And Science bows them in&mdash;

But do one face us suddenly&mdash; Jehovah's Watch&mdash;is wrong.

Emily Dickinson

Emily Dickinson





Superfluous were the Sun


Superfluous were the Sun

When Excellence be dead

He were superfluous every Day

For every Day be said

That syllable whose Faith

Just saves it from Despair

And whose "I'll meet You" hesitates If Love inquire "Where"?

Upon His dateless Fame

Our Periods may lie

As Stars that drop anonymous

From an abundant sky.

Emily Dickinson





Surgeons must be very careful


Surgeons must be very careful

When they take the knife!

Underneath their fine incisions

Stirs the Culprit&mdash;Life!

Emily Dickinson






Suspense&mdash;is Hostiler than Death&mdash; Death&mdash;tho'soever Broad,

Next precious

Those that rose to go&mdash;

Then thought of Us, and stayed.

T was just this time last year I died.

'T was just this time last year I died.

I know I heard the corn,

When I was carried by the farms,--

It had the tassels on.

I thought how yellow it would look

When Richard went to mill;

And then I wanted to get out,

But something held my will.

I thought just how red apples wedged

The stubble's joints between;

And carts went stooping round the fields To take the pumpkins in.

I wondered which would miss me least,

And when Thanksgiving came,

If father'd multiply the plates

To make an even sum.

And if my stocking hung too high,

Would it blur the Christmas glee,

That not a Santa Claus could reach

The altitude of me?

But this sort grieved myself, and so

I thought how it would be

When just this time, some perfect year, Themselves should come to me.

Take your Heaven further on


Take your Heaven further on&mdash; This&mdash;to Heaven divine Has gone&mdash; Had You earlier blundered in

Possibly, e'en You had seen

An Eternity&mdash;put on&mdash; Now&mdash;to ring a Door beyond

Than this Sufferer polite&mdash;

Dressed to meet You&mdash;

When a fracture&mdash;we discover&mdash; Or a splintered Crown&mdash;

Makes the Heavens portable&mdash;

And the Gods&mdash;a lie&mdash; Doubtless&mdash;"Adam"&mdash;scowled at Eden&mdash; For his perjury!

Talk with prudence to a Beggar


Talk with prudence to a Beggar

Of "Potose," and the mines!

Reverently, to the Hungry

Of your viands, and your wines!

Cautious, hint to any Captive

You have passed enfranchised feet!

Anecdotes of air in Dungeons

Have sometimes proved deadly sweet!

Tell All The Truth

Tell all the truth but tell it slant,

Success in circuit lies,

Too bright for our infirm delight

The truth's superb surprise;

As lightning to the children eased

With explanation kind,

The truth must dazzle gradually

Or every man be blind.

That after Horror&mdash;that 'twas us&mdash; That passed the mouldering Pier&mdash; Just as the Granite Crumb let go&mdash; Our Savior, by a Hair&mdash;

And could be mighty, if I liked&mdash; That Day&mdash;the Days among&mdash; Glows Central&mdash;like a Jewel

The Minor One&mdash;that gleamed behind&mdash; And Vaster&mdash;of the World's.

That I did always love


That I did always love

I bring thee Proof

That till I loved

I never lived&mdash;Enough&mdash; That I shall love alway&mdash;

Nothing to show

But Calvary&mdash;

That is solemn we have ended

Still to be explained.

The Angle of a Landscape


The Angle of a Landscape&mdash;

That every time I wake&mdash;

Between my Curtain and the Wall

Upon an ample Crack&mdash;

Like a Venetian&mdash;waiting&mdash; Accosts my open eye&mdash;

Is just a Bough of Apples&mdash;

Held slanting, in the Sky&mdash;

The Pattern of a Chimney&mdash;

The Forehead of a Hill&mdash;

Sometimes&mdash;a Vane's Forefinger&mdash; But that's&mdash;Occasional&mdash; The Seasons&mdash;shift&mdash;my Picture&mdash; Upon my Emerald Bough,

I wake&mdash;to find no&mdash;Emeralds&mdash; Then&mdash;Diamonds&mdash;which the Snow From Polar Caskets&mdash;fetched me&mdash; The Chimney&mdash;and the Hill&mdash; And just the Steeple's finger&mdash; These&mdash;never stir at all&mdash; Emily Dickinson





The Battle fought between the Soul

The Bee is not afraid of me


The Bee is not afraid of me.

The Brooks laugh louder when I come&mdash; The Breezes madder play;

Wherefore mine eye thy silver mists,

Wherefore, Oh Summer's Day?

The Beggar Lad&mdash;dies early


The Beggar Lad&mdash;dies early&mdash; It's Somewhat in the Cold&mdash;

And Somewhat in the Trudging feet&mdash; And haply, in the World&mdash;

The Cruel&mdash;smiling&mdash;bowing World&mdash; That took its Cambric Way&mdash;

Nor heard the timid cry for "Bread"&mdash;

"Sweet Lady&mdash;Charity"&mdash; Among Redeemed Children

If Trudging feet may stand

The Barefoot time forgotten&mdash;so&mdash; The Sleet&mdash;the bitter Wind&mdash; The Childish Hands that teased for Pence Lifted adoring&mdash;them&mdash; To Him whom never Ragged&mdash;Coat Did supplicate in vain&mdash;

The Birds begun at Four o'clock


The Birds begun at Four o'clock&mdash; Their period for Dawn&mdash;

A Music numerous as space&mdash;

But neighboring as Noon&mdash;

I could not count their Force&mdash; Their Voices did expend

As Brook by Brook bestows itself

To multiply the Pond.

Their Witnesses were not&mdash;

Except occasional man&mdash;

In homely industry arrayed&mdash;

To overtake the Morn&mdash;

Nor was it for applause&mdash;

That I could ascertain&mdash;

But independent Ecstasy

Of Deity and Men&mdash;

By Six, the Flood had done&mdash;

No Tumult there had been

Of Dressing, or Departure&mdash;

And yet the Band was gone&mdash;

The Sun engrossed the East&mdash;

The Day controlled the World&mdash; The Miracle that introduced

Forgotten, as fulfilled.

The Brain is just the weight of God—

For—Heft them—Pound for Pound—

And they will differ—if they do—

As Syllable from Sound—

The bustle in a house

The morning after death

Is solemnest of industries

Enacted upon earth,--

The sweeping up the heart,

And putting love away

We shall not want to use again

Until eternity.

And Caesar&mdash;mean&mdash;

In the Comparison&mdash;

Baseless Emperor&mdash;

Ruler of Nought&mdash;

Yet swaying all&mdash;

Grown bye and bye

To hold mistaken

His pretty estimates

Of Prickly Things

He gains the skill

Sorrowful&mdash;as certain&mdash; Men&mdash;to anticipate

Instead of Kings&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





The Color of a Queen, is this


The Color of a Queen, is this&mdash; The Color of a Sun

At setting&mdash;this and Amber&mdash; Beryl&mdash;and this, at Noon&mdash; And when at night&mdash;Auroran widths Fling suddenly on men&mdash;

'Tis this&mdash;and Witchcraft&mdash;nature keeps A Rank&mdash;for Iodine&mdash; Emily Dickinson





The Color of the Grave is Green


The Color of the Grave is Green&mdash; The Outer Grave&mdash;I mean&mdash; You would not know it from the Field&mdash; Except it own a Stone&mdash;

To help the fond&mdash;to find it&mdash; Too infinite asleep

To stop and tell them where it is&mdash; But just a Daisy&mdash;deep&mdash; The Color of the Grave is white&mdash; The outer Grave&mdash;I mean&mdash; You would not know it from the Drifts&mdash; In Winter&mdash;till the Sun&mdash; Has furrowed out the Aisles&mdash; Then&mdash;higher than the Land

The little Dwelling Houses rise

Where each&mdash;has left a friend&mdash; The Color of the Grave within&mdash; The Duplicate&mdash;I mean&mdash; Not all the Snows could make it white&mdash; Not all the Summers&mdash;Green&mdash; You've seen the Color&mdash;maybe&mdash; Upon a Bonnet bound&mdash;

When that you met it with before&mdash; The Ferret&mdash;cannot find&mdash; Emily Dickinson





The Court is far away


The Court is far away&mdash;

No Umpire&mdash;have I&mdash;

My Sovereign is offended&mdash;

To gain his grace&mdash;I'd die!

I'll seek his royal feet&mdash;

I'll say&mdash;Remember&mdash;King&mdash; Thou shalt&mdash;thyself&mdash;one day&mdash;a Child&mdash; Implore a larger&mdash;thing&mdash; That Empire&mdash;is of Czars&mdash; As small&mdash;they say&mdash;as I&mdash; Grant me&mdash;that day&mdash;the royalty&mdash; To intercede&mdash;for Thee&mdash; Emily Dickinson





The cricket sang,

The cricket sang,

And set the sun,

And workmen finished, one by one,

Their seam the day upon.

The low grass loaded with the dew,

The twilight stood as strangers do

With hat in hand, polite and new,

To stay as if, or go.

A vastness, as a neighbor, came,--

A wisdom without face or name,

A peace, as hemispheres at home,--

And so the night became.

Emily Dickinson





The Daisy follows soft the Sun


The Daisy follows soft the Sun&mdash; And when his golden walk is done&mdash; Sits shyly at his feet&mdash;

He&mdash;waking&mdash;finds the flower there&mdash; Wherefore&mdash;Marauder&mdash;art thou here?

Because, Sir, love is sweet!

We are the Flower&mdash;Thou the Sun!

Forgive us, if as days decline&mdash; We nearer steal to Thee!

Enamored of the parting West&mdash; The peace&mdash;the flight&mdash;the Amethyst&mdash; Night's possibility!

Emily Dickinson





The Day Came Slow

The day came slow, till five o'clock,

Then sprang before the hills,

Like hindered rubies, or the light,

A sudden musket spills.

The purple could not keep the east.

The sunrise shook from fold.

Like breadths of topaz, packed a night, The lady just unrolled.

The happy winds their timbrels took;

The birds in docile rows,

Arranged themselves around their prince.

(The wind is prince of those.)

The orchard sparkled like a Jew,---

How mighty 'twas to stay,

A guest in this stupendous place,

The parlor of the day.

Emily Dickinson

The Day that I was crowned


The Day that I was crowned

Was like the other Days&mdash;

Until the Coronation came&mdash;

And then&mdash;'twas Otherwise&mdash; As Carbon in the Coal

And Carbon in the Gem

Are One&mdash;and yet the former

Were dull for Diadem&mdash;

I rose, and all was plain&mdash;

But when the Day declined

Myself and It, in Majesty

Were equally&mdash;adorned&mdash; The Grace that I&mdash;was chose&mdash; To Me&mdash;surpassed the Crown

That was the Witness for the Grace&mdash;

'Twas even that 'twas Mine&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





The Day undressed&mdash;Herself


The Day undressed&mdash;Herself&mdash; Her Garter&mdash;was of Gold&mdash; Her Petticoat&mdash;of Purple plain&mdash; Her Dimities&mdash;as old

Exactly&mdash;as the World&mdash; And yet the newest Star&mdash;

Enrolled upon the Hemisphere

Be wrinkled&mdash;much as Her&mdash; Too near to God&mdash;to pray&mdash; Too near to Heaven&mdash;to fear&mdash; The Lady of the Occident

Retired without a care&mdash;

Her Candle so expire

The flickering be seen

On Ball of Mast in Bosporus&mdash; And Dome&mdash;and Window Pane&mdash; Emily Dickinson

The difference between Despair


The difference between Despair

And Fear&mdash;is like the One

Between the instant of a Wreck

And when the Wreck has been&mdash; The Mind is smooth&mdash;no Motion&mdash; Contented as the Eye

Upon the Forehead of a Bust&mdash; That knows&mdash;it cannot see&mdash; Emily Dickinson






The Doomed&mdash;regard the Sunrise With different Delight&mdash;

Because&mdash;when next it burns abroad They doubt to witness it&mdash;

The Man&mdash;to die&mdash;tomorrow&mdash; Harks for the Meadow Bird&mdash;

Because its Music stirs the Axe

That clamors for his head&mdash;

Joyful&mdash;to whom the Sunrise

Precedes Enamored&mdash;Day&mdash; Joyful&mdash;for whom the Meadow Bird Has ought but Elegy!

Emily Dickinson





The Doomed—regard the Sunrise


The Doomed—regard the Sunrise

With different Delight—

Because—when next it burns abroad

They doubt to witness it—

The Man—to die—tomorrow—

Harks for the Meadow Bird—

Because its Music stirs the Axe

That clamors for his head—

Joyful—to whom the Sunrise

Precedes Enamored—Day—

Joyful—for whom the Meadow Bird

Has ought but Elegy!

The Drop, that wrestles in the Sea


The Drop, that wrestles in the Sea&mdash; Forgets her own locality&mdash;

As I&mdash;toward Thee&mdash;

She knows herself an incense small&mdash; Yet small&mdash;she sighs&mdash;if All&mdash;is All&mdash; How larger&mdash;be?

The Ocean&mdash;smiles&mdash;at her Conceit&mdash; But she, forgetting Amphitrite&mdash; Pleads&mdash;"Me"?

The dying need but little, dear,--

The dying need but little, dear,--

A glass of water's all,

A flower's unobtrusive face

To punctuate the wall,

A fan, perhaps, a friend's regret,

And certainly that one

No color in the rainbow

Perceives when you are gone.

Emily Dickinson






The face I carry with me&mdash;last&mdash; When I go out of Time&mdash;

To take my Rank&mdash;by&mdash;in the West&mdash; That face&mdash;will just be thine&mdash; I'll hand it to the Angel&mdash;

That&mdash;Sir&mdash;was my Degree&mdash; In Kingdoms&mdash;you have heard the Raised&mdash; Refer to&mdash;possibly.

He'll take it&mdash;scan it&mdash;step aside&mdash; Return&mdash;with such a crown

As Gabriel&mdash;never capered at&mdash; And beg me put it on&mdash;

And then&mdash;he'll turn me round and round&mdash; To an admiring sky&mdash;

As one that bore her Master's name&mdash; Sufficient Royalty!

The feet of people walking home


The feet of people walking home

With gayer sandals go&mdash;

The Crocus&mdash; til she rises

The Vassal of the snow&mdash;

The lips at Hallelujah

Long years of practise bore

Til bye and bye these Bargemen

Walked singing on the shore.

Pearls are the Diver's farthings

Extorted from the Sea&mdash;

Pinions&mdash; the Seraph's wagon

Pedestrian once&mdash; as we&mdash; Night is the morning's Canvas

Larceny&mdash; legacy&mdash;

Death, but our rapt attention

To Immortality.

My figures fail to tell me

How far the Village lies&mdash;

Whose peasants are the Angels&mdash; Whose Cantons dot the skies&mdash; My Classics veil their faces&mdash; My faith that Dark adores&mdash;

Which from its solemn abbeys

Such ressurection pours.

Emily Dickinson





The Fingers of the Light


The Fingers of the Light

Tapped soft upon the Town

With "I am great and cannot wait

So therefore let me in."

"You're soon," the Town replied,

"My Faces are asleep&mdash;

But swear, and I will let you by,

You will not wake them up."

The easy Guest complied

But once within the Town

The transport of His Countenance

Awakened Maid and Man

The Neighbor in the Pool

Upon His Hip elate

Made loud obeisance and the Gnat

Held up His Cup for Light.

Emily Dickinson





The first Day that I was a Life


The first Day that I was a Life

I recollect it&mdash;How still&mdash; That last Day that I was a Life

I recollect it&mdash;as well&mdash;

'Twas stiller&mdash;though the first Was still&mdash;

"Twas empty&mdash;but the first Was full&mdash;

This&mdash;was my finallest Occasion&mdash; But then

My tenderer Experiment

Toward Men&mdash;

"Which choose I"?

That&mdash;I cannot say&mdash;

"Which choose They"?

Question Memory!

Emily Dickinson





The first Day's Night had come


The first Day's Night had come&mdash; And grateful that a thing

So terrible&mdash;had been endured&mdash; I told my Soul to sing&mdash;

She said her Strings were snapt&mdash; Her Bow&mdash;to Atoms blown&mdash; And so to mend her&mdash;gave me work Until another Morn&mdash;

And then&mdash;a Day as huge

As Yesterdays in pairs,

Unrolled its horror in my face&mdash; Until it blocked my eyes&mdash;

My Brain&mdash;begun to laugh&mdash; I mumbled&mdash;like a fool&mdash; And tho' 'tis Years ago&mdash;that Day&mdash; My Brain keeps giggling&mdash;still.

And Something's odd&mdash;within&mdash; That person that I was&mdash;

And this One&mdash;do not feel the same&mdash; Could it be Madness&mdash;this?

Emily Dickinson





The Flower must not blame the Bee


The Flower must not blame the Bee&mdash; That seeketh his felicity

Too often at her door&mdash;

But teach the Footman from Vevay&mdash; Mistress is "not at home"&mdash;to say&mdash; To people&mdash;any more!

The Future&mdash;never spoke


The Future&mdash;never spoke&mdash; Nor will He&mdash;like the Dumb&mdash; Reveal by sign&mdash;a syllable

Of His Profound To Come&mdash;

But when the News be ripe&mdash;

Escape&mdash;or Substitute&mdash; Indifference to Him&mdash;

The Gentian weaves her fringes


The Gentian weaves her fringes&mdash; The Maple's loom is red&mdash;

My departing blossoms

Obviate parade.

A brief, but patient illness&mdash; An hour to prepare,

And one below this morning

Is where the angels are&mdash;

It was a short procession,

The Bobolink was there&mdash;

An aged Bee addressed us&mdash;

And then we knelt in prayer&mdash; We trust that she was willing&mdash; We ask that we may be.

Summer&mdash;Sister&mdash;Seraph!

Let us go with thee!

In the name of the Bee&mdash;

And of the Butterfly&mdash;

And of the Breeze&mdash;Amen!

The good Will of a Flower

The Man who would possess

Must first present

Certificate

Of minted Holiness.

Confer upon My flower—

Refracted but a Countenance—

For I—inhabit Her—

Emily Dickinson





The Grass so little has to do

The Grass so little has to do –

A Sphere of simple Green –

With only Butterflies to brood

And Bees to entertain –

And stir all day to pretty Tunes

The Breezes fetch along –

And hold the Sunshine in its lap

And bow to everything –

And thread the Dews, all night, like Pearls –

And make itself so fine

A Duchess were too common

For such a noticing –

And even when it dies – to pass

In Odors so divine –

Like Lowly spices, lain to sleep –

Or Spikenards, perishing –

And then, in Sovereign Barns to dwell –

And dream the Days away,

The Grass so little has to do

I wish I were a Hay –

Emily Dickinson





The Guest is gold and crimson


The Guest is gold and crimson&mdash; An Opal guest and gray&mdash;

Of Ermine is his doublet&mdash;

His Capuchin gay&mdash;

He reaches town at nightfall&mdash; He stops at every door&mdash;

Who looks for him at morning

I pray him too&mdash;explore

The Lark's pure territory&mdash;

Or the Lapwing's shore!

Emily Dickinson





The hallowing of Pain


The hallowing of Pain

Like hallowing of Heaven,

Obtains at a corporeal cost&mdash; The Summit is not given

To Him who strives severe

At middle of the Hill&mdash;

But He who has achieved the Top&mdash; All&mdash;is the price of All&mdash; Emily Dickinson





The heart asks pleasure first

The heart asks pleasure first

And then, excuse from pain-

And then, those little anodynes

That deaden suffering;

And then, to go to sleep;

And then, if it should be

The will of its Inquisitor,

The liberty to die.

Emily Dickinson

The privilege to die&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





The Heart has narrow Banks


The Heart has narrow Banks

It measures like the Sea

In mighty&mdash;unremitting Bass

And Blue Monotony

Till Hurricane bisect

And as itself discerns

Its sufficient Area

The Heart convulsive learns

That Calm is but a Wall

Of unattempted Gauze

An instant's Push demolishes

A Questioning&mdash;dissolves.

Emily Dickinson





The Heaven vests for Each


The Heaven vests for Each

In that small Deity

It craved the grace to worship

Some bashful Summer's Day&mdash;

Half shrinking from the Glory

It importuned to see

Till these faint Tabernacles drop

In full Eternity&mdash;

How imminent the Venture&mdash;

As one should sue a Star&mdash;

For His mean sake to leave the Row

And entertain Despair&mdash;

A Clemency so common&mdash;

We almost cease to fear&mdash;

Enabling the minutest&mdash;

And furthest&mdash;to adore&mdash; Emily Dickinson





The Himmaleh was known to stoop


The Himmaleh was known to stoop

Unto the Daisy low&mdash;

Transported with Compassion

That such a Doll should grow

Where Tent by Tent&mdash;Her Universe Hung out its Flags of Snow&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





The Hollows round His eager Eyes


The Hollows round His eager Eyes

Were Pages where to read

Pathetic Histories&mdash;although

Himself had not complained.

Biography to All who passed

Of Unobtrusive Pain

Except for the italic Face

Endured, unhelped&mdash;unknown.

Emily Dickinson





The Judge is like the Owl


The Judge is like the Owl&mdash;

I've heard my Father tell&mdash;

And Owls do build in Oaks&mdash;

So here's an Amber Sill&mdash;

That slanted in my Path&mdash;

When going to the Barn&mdash;

And if it serve You for a House&mdash; Itself is not in vain&mdash;

About the price&mdash;'tis small&mdash; I only ask a Tune

At Midnight&mdash;Let the Owl select His favorite Refrain.

Emily Dickinson





The Juggler's Hat her Country is


The Juggler's Hat her Country is&mdash; The Mountain Gorse&mdash;the Bee's!

Emily Dickinson





The Lady feeds Her little Bird


The Lady feeds Her little Bird

At rarer intervals&mdash;

The little Bird would not dissent

But meekly recognize

The Gulf between the Hand and Her

And crumbless and afar

And fainting, on Her yellow Knee

Fall softly, and adore&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





The Lamp burns sure&mdash;within


The Lamp burns sure&mdash;within&mdash; Tho' Serfs&mdash;supply the Oil&mdash; It matters not the busy Wick&mdash; At her phosphoric toil!

The Slave&mdash;forgets&mdash;to fill&mdash; The Lamp&mdash;burns golden&mdash;on&mdash; Unconscious that the oil is out&mdash; As that the Slave&mdash;is gone.

Emily Dickinson

The last Night that She lived


The last Night that She lived

It was a Common Night

Except the Dying&mdash;this to Us

Made Nature different

We noticed smallest things&mdash;

Things overlooked before

By this great light upon our Minds

Italicized&mdash;as 'twere.

As We went out and in

Between Her final Room

And Rooms where Those to be alive

Tomorrow were, a Blame

That Others could exist

While She must finish quite

A Jealousy for Her arose

So nearly infinite&mdash;

We waited while She passed&mdash;

It was a narrow time&mdash;

Too jostled were Our Souls to speak

At length the notice came.

She mentioned, and forgot&mdash;

Then lightly as a Reed

Bent to the Water, struggled scarce&mdash; Consented, and was dead&mdash;

And We&mdash;We placed the Hair&mdash; And drew the Head erect&mdash;

And then an awful leisure was

Belief to regulate&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





The Leaves like Women interchange


The Leaves like Women interchange

Exclusive Confidence&mdash;

Somewhat of nods and somewhat

Portentous inference.

The Parties in both cases

Enjoining secrecy&mdash;

Inviolable compact

To notoriety.

Emily Dickinson






The Lightning playeth&mdash;all the while&mdash; But when He singeth&mdash;then&mdash; Ourselves are conscious He exist&mdash; And we approach Him&mdash;stern&mdash; With Insulators&mdash;and a Glove&mdash; Whose short&mdash;sepulchral Bass

Alarms us&mdash;tho' His Yellow feet May pass&mdash;and counterpass&mdash; Upon the Ropes&mdash;above our Head&mdash; Continual&mdash;with the News&mdash; Nor We so much as check our speech&mdash; Nor stop to cross Ourselves&mdash; Emily Dickinson

The Loneliness One dare not sound


The Loneliness One dare not sound&mdash; And would as soon surmise

As in its Grave go plumbing

To ascertain the size&mdash;

The Loneliness whose worst alarm

Is lest itself should see&mdash;

And perish from before itself

For just a scrutiny&mdash;

The Horror not to be surveyed&mdash; But skirted in the Dark&mdash;

With Consciousness suspended&mdash; And Being under Lock&mdash;

I fear me this&mdash;is Loneliness&mdash; The Maker of the soul

Its Caverns and its Corridors

Illuminate&mdash;or seal&mdash; Emily Dickinson





The lonesome for they know not What


The lonesome for they know not What&mdash; The Eastern Exiles&mdash;be&mdash; Who strayed beyond the Amber line

Some madder Holiday&mdash;

And ever since&mdash;the purple Moat They strive to climb&mdash;in vain&mdash; As Birds&mdash;that tumble from the clouds Do fumble at the strain&mdash;

The Blessed Ether&mdash;taught them&mdash; Some Transatlantic Morn&mdash;

When Heaven&mdash;was too common&mdash;to miss&mdash; Too sure&mdash;to dote upon!

Emily Dickinson





The Love a Life can show Below


The Love a Life can show Below

Is but a filament, I know,

Of that diviner thing

That faints upon the face of Noon&mdash; And smites the Tinder in the Sun&mdash; And hinders Gabriel's Wing&mdash;

'Tis this&mdash;in Music&mdash;hints and sways&mdash; And far abroad on Summer days&mdash; Distils uncertain pain&mdash;

'Tis this enamors in the East&mdash; And tints the Transit in the West

With harrowing Iodine&mdash;

'Tis this&mdash;invites&mdash;appalls&mdash;endows&mdash; Flits&mdash;glimmers&mdash;proves&mdash;dissolves&mdash; Returns&mdash;suggests&mdash;convicts&mdash;enchants&mdash; Then&mdash;flings in Paradise&mdash; Emily Dickinson





The Luxury to apprehend


The Luxury to apprehend

The Luxury 'twould be

To look at Thee a single time

An Epicure of Me

In whatsoever Presence makes

Till for a further Food

I scarcely recollect to starve

So first am I supplied&mdash;

The Luxury to meditate

The Luxury it was

To banguet on thy Countenance

A Sumptuousness bestows

On plainer Days, whose Table far

As Certainty can see

Is laden with a single Crumb

The Consciousness of Thee.

Emily Dickinson

The Manner of its Death


The Manner of its Death

When Certain it must die&mdash;

'Tis deemed a privilege to choose&mdash;

'Twas Major Andre's Way&mdash;

When Choice of Life&mdash;is past&mdash; There yet remains a Love

Its little Fate to stipulate&mdash; How small in those who live&mdash; The Miracle to tease

With Bable of the styles&mdash;

How "they are Dying mostly&mdash;now"&mdash; And Customs at "St. James"!

The Missing All&mdash;prevented Me From missing minor Things.

If nothing larger than a World's

Departure from a Hinge&mdash;

Or Sun's extinction, be observed&mdash;

'Twas not so large that I

For Curiosity.

The Months have ends&mdash;the Years&mdash;a knot&mdash; No Power can untie

To stretch a little further

A Skein of Misery&mdash;

The Earth lays back these tired lives

In her mysterious Drawers&mdash;

Too tenderly, that any doubt

An ultimate Repose&mdash;

The manner of the Children&mdash;

Who weary of the Day&mdash;

Themself&mdash;the noisy Plaything They cannot put away&mdash;

The Moon is distant from the Sea


The Moon is distant from the Sea&mdash; And yet, with Amber Hands&mdash;

She leads Him&mdash;docile as a Boy&mdash; Along appointed Sands&mdash;

He never misses a Degree&mdash;

Obedient to Her Eye

He comes just so far&mdash;toward the Town&mdash; Just so far&mdash;goes away&mdash; Oh, Signor, Thine, the Amber Hand&mdash; And mine&mdash;the distant Sea&mdash; Obedient to the least command

Thine eye impose on me&mdash;

A Night or two ago&mdash;

And now she turns Her perfect Face

Upon the World below&mdash;

Her Forehead is of Amplest Blonde&mdash; Her Cheek&mdash;a Beryl hewn&mdash; Her Eye unto the Summer Dew

The likest I have known&mdash;

Her Lips of Amber never part&mdash; But what must be the smile

Upon Her Friend she could confer

Were such Her Silver Will&mdash;

And what a privilege to be

But the remotest Star&mdash;

As Nature did not care&mdash;

And piled her Blossoms on&mdash;

And further to parade a Joy

Her Victim stared upon&mdash;

The Birds declaim their Tunes&mdash; Pronouncing every word

Like Hammers&mdash;Did they know they fell Like Litanies of Lead&mdash;

On here and there&mdash;a creature&mdash; They'd modify the Glee

To fit some Crucifixal Clef&mdash; Some Key of Calvary&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





The morns are meeker than they were


The morns are meeker than they were&mdash; The nuts are getting brown&mdash;

The berry's cheek is plumper&mdash; The Rose is out of town.

The Maple wears a gayer scarf&mdash; The field a scarlet gown&mdash;

Lest I should be old fashioned

I'll put a trinket on.

Emily Dickinson





The Mountain sat upon the Plain


The Mountain sat upon the Plain

In his tremendous Chair&mdash;

His observation omnifold,

His inquest, everywhere&mdash;

The Seasons played around his knees

Like Children round a sire&mdash;

Grandfather of the Days is He

Of Dawn, the Ancestor&mdash;

Emily Dickinson






The Mountains&mdash;grow unnoticed&mdash; Their Purple figures rise

Without attempt&mdash;Exhaustion&mdash; Assistance&mdash;or Applause&mdash; In Their Eternal Faces

The Sun&mdash;with just delight

Looks long&mdash;and last&mdash;and golden&mdash; For fellowship&mdash;at night&mdash; Emily Dickinson





The Mountains—grow unnoticed


The Mountains—grow unnoticed—

Their Purple figures rise

Without attempt—Exhaustion—

Assistance—or Applause—

In Their Eternal Faces

The Sun—with just delight

Looks long—and last—and golden—

For fellowship—at night—

The Murmur of a Bee


The Murmur of a Bee

A Witchcraft&mdash;yieldeth me&mdash; If any ask me why&mdash;

'Twere easier to die&mdash;

Than tell&mdash;

The Red upon the Hill

Taketh away my will&mdash;

If anybody sneer&mdash;

Take care&mdash;for God is here&mdash; That's all.

The Breaking of the Day

Addeth to my Degree&mdash;

If any ask me how&mdash;

Artist&mdash;who drew me so&mdash; Must tell!

Emily Dickinson





The Mystery of Pain

Pain has an element of blank;

It cannot recollect

When it began, or if there were

A day when it was not.

It has no future but itself,

Its infinite realms contain

Its past, enlightened to perceive

New periods of pain.

Emily Dickinson





The name&mdash;of it&mdash;is "Autumn"


The name&mdash;of it&mdash;is "Autumn"&mdash; The hue&mdash;of it&mdash;is Blood&mdash; An Artery&mdash;upon the Hill&mdash; A Vein&mdash;along the Road&mdash; Great Globules&mdash;in the Alleys&mdash; And Oh, the Shower of Stain&mdash; When Winds&mdash;upset the Basin&mdash; And spill the Scarlet Rain&mdash;

It sprinkles Bonnets&mdash;far below&mdash; It gathers ruddy Pools&mdash;

Then&mdash;eddies like a Rose&mdash;away&mdash; Upon Vermilion Wheels&mdash;

The nearest Dream recedes&mdash;unrealized&mdash; The Heaven we chase,

Like the June Bee&mdash;before the School Boy, Invites the Race&mdash;

Stoops&mdash;to an easy Clover&mdash; Dips&mdash;evades&mdash;teases&mdash;deploys&mdash; Then&mdash;to the Royal Clouds

Lifts his light Pinnace&mdash;

Heedless of the Boy&mdash;

Staring&mdash;bewildered&mdash;at the mocking sky&mdash; Homesick for steadfast Honey&mdash; Ah, the Bee flies not

That brews that rare variety!

Emily Dickinson





The nearest dream recedes, unrealized

The nearest dream recedes, unrealized.

The heaven we chase

Like the June bee

Before the school-boy

Invites the race;

Stoops to an easy clover

Dips--evades--teases--deploys;

Then to the royal clouds

Lifts his light pinnace

Heedless of the boy

Staring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.

Homesick for steadfast honey,

Ah! the bee flies not

That brews that rare variety.

The Night was wide, and furnished scant With but a single Star&mdash;

That often as a Cloud it met&mdash; Blew out itself&mdash;for fear&mdash; The Wind pursued the little Bush&mdash; And drove away the Leaves

November left&mdash;then clambered up And fretted in the Eaves&mdash;

No Squirrel went abroad&mdash;

A Dog's belated feet

Like intermittent Plush, he heard

Adown the empty Street&mdash;

To feel if Blinds be fast&mdash;

And closer to the fire&mdash;

Her little Rocking Chair to draw&mdash; And shiver for the Poor&mdash;

The Housewife's gentle Task&mdash; How pleasanter&mdash;said she

Unto the Sofa opposite&mdash;

The Sleet&mdash;than May, no Thee&mdash; Emily Dickinson






The One who could repeat the Summer day&mdash; Were greater than itself&mdash;though He Minutest of Mankind should be&mdash; And He&mdash;could reproduce the Sun&mdash; At period of going down&mdash;

The Lingering&mdash;and the Stain&mdash;I mean&mdash; When Orient have been outgrown

And Occident&mdash;become Unknown&mdash; His Name&mdash;remain&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





The only ghost I ever saw

The only ghost I ever saw

Was dressed in mechlin, --so;

He wore no sandal on his foot,

And stepped like flakes of snow.

His gait was soundless, like the bird, But rapid, like the roe;

His fashions quaint, mosaic,

Or, haply, mistletoe.

Hi conversation seldom,

His laughter like the breeze

That dies away in dimples

Among the pensive trees.

Our interview was transient, --

Of me, himself was shy;

And God forbid I look behind

Since that appalling day!

Emily Dickinson





The Only News I know


The Only News I know

Is Bulletins all Day

From Immortality.

The Only Shows I see&mdash;

Tomorrow and Today&mdash;

Perchance Eternity&mdash;

The Only One I meet

Is God&mdash;The Only Street&mdash; Existence&mdash;This traversed

If Other News there be&mdash;

Or Admirable Show&mdash;

I'll tell it You&mdash;

Its Picture publishes&mdash;precise&mdash; As is the inner Brand&mdash;

On fine&mdash;Arterial Canvas&mdash; A Cheek&mdash;perchance a Brow&mdash; The Star's whole Secret&mdash;in the Lake&mdash; Eyes were not meant to know.

The pedigree of honey

The pedigree of honey

Does not concern the bee;

A clover, any time, to him

Is aristocracy.

The Poets light but Lamps


The Poets light but Lamps&mdash;

Themselves&mdash;go out&mdash; The Wicks they stimulate&mdash;

If vital Light

Inhere as do the Suns&mdash;

Each Age a Lens

The power to be true to You

The Province of the Saved

The Railway Train

I like to see it lap the miles,

And lick the valleys up,

And stop to feed itself at tanks;

And then, prodigious, step

Around a pile of mountains,

And, supercilious, peer

In shanties by the sides of roads;

And then a quarry pare

To fit its sides, and crawl between,

Complaining all the while

In horrid, hooting stanza;

Then chase itself down the hill

And neigh like Boanerges;

Then, punctual as a star,

Stop - docile and omnipotent -

At its own stable door.

Emily Dickinson





The rainbow never tells me


The rainbow never tells me

That gust and storm are by,

Yet is she more convincing

Than Philosophy.

My flowers turn from Forums&mdash; Yet eloquent declare

What Cato couldn't prove me

Except the birds were here!

The Robin for the Crumb


The Robin for the Crumb

Returns no syllable

But long records the Lady's name

In Silver Chronicle.

Emily Dickinson





The Robin is the One


The Robin is the One

That interrupt the Morn

With hurried&mdash;few&mdash;express Reports When March is scarcely on&mdash;

The Robin is the One

That overflow the Noon

With her cherubic quantity&mdash;

An April but begun&mdash;

The Robin is the One

That speechless from her Nest

Submit that Home&mdash;and Certainty And Sanctity, are best

Emily Dickinson





The Robin's my Criterion for Tune


The Robin's my Criterion for Tune&mdash; Because I grow&mdash;where Robins do&mdash; But, were I Cuckoo born&mdash;

I'd swear by him&mdash;

The ode familiar&mdash;rules the Noon&mdash; The Buttercup's, my Whim for Bloom&mdash; Because, we're Orchard sprung&mdash; But, were I Britain born,

I'd Daisies spurn&mdash;

None but the Nut&mdash;October fit&mdash; Because, through dropping it,

The Seasons flit&mdash;I'm taught&mdash; Without the Snow's Tableau

Winter, were lie&mdash;to me&mdash; Because I see&mdash;New Englandly&mdash; The Queen, discerns like me&mdash; Provincially&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





The Rose did caper on her cheek


The Rose did caper on her cheek&mdash; Her Bodice rose and fell&mdash;

Her pretty speech&mdash;like drunken men&mdash; Did stagger pitiful&mdash;

Her fingers fumbled at her work&mdash; Her needle would not go&mdash;

What ailed so smart a little Maid&mdash; It puzzled me to know&mdash;

Till opposite&mdash;I spied a cheek That bore another Rose&mdash;

Just opposite&mdash;Another speech That like the Drunkard goes&mdash; A Vest that like her Bodice, danced&mdash; To the immortal tune&mdash;

Till those two troubled&mdash;little Clocks Ticked softly into one.

Emily Dickinson





The Service without Hope


The Service without Hope&mdash;

Is tenderest, I think&mdash;

Because 'tis unsustained

By stint&mdash;Rewarded Work&mdash; Has impetus of Gain&mdash;

And impetus of Goal&mdash;

There is no Diligence like that

That knows not an Until&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





The show is not the show,

The show is not the show,

But they that go.

Menagerie to me

My neighbor be.

Fair play--

Both went to see.

Emily Dickinson





The Skies can't keep their secret!


The Skies can't keep their secret!

They tell it to the Hills&mdash;

The Hills just tell the Orchards&mdash; And they&mdash;the Daffodils!

A Bird&mdash;by chance&mdash;that goes that way&mdash; Soft overhears the whole&mdash;

If I should bribe the little Bird&mdash; Who knows but she would tell?

I think I won't&mdash;however&mdash; It's finer&mdash;not to know&mdash; If Summer were an Axiom&mdash;

What sorcery had Snow?

So keep your secret&mdash;Father!

I would not&mdash;if I could,

Know what the Sapphire Fellows, do,

In your new-fashioned world!

Emily Dickinson





The sky is low, the clouds are mean,

The sky is low, the clouds are mean,

A travelling flake of snow

Across a barn or through a rut

Debates if it will go.

A narrow wind complains all day

How some one treated him;

Nature, like us, is sometimes caught

Without her diadem.

Emily Dickinson





The Soul has Bandaged moments


The Soul has Bandaged moments&mdash; When too appalled to stir&mdash;

She feels some ghastly Fright come up

And stop to look at her&mdash;

Salute her&mdash;with long fingers&mdash; Caress her freezing hair&mdash;

Sip, Goblin, from the very lips

The Lover&mdash;hovered&mdash;o'er&mdash; Unworthy, that a thought so mean

Accost a Theme&mdash;so&mdash;fair&mdash; The soul has moments of Escape&mdash; When bursting all the doors&mdash; She dances like a Bomb, abroad,

And swings upon the Hours,

As do the Bee&mdash;delirious borne&mdash; Long Dungeoned from his Rose&mdash; Touch Liberty&mdash;then know no more, But Noon, and Paradise&mdash;

The Soul's retaken moments&mdash;

When, Felon led along,

With shackles on the plumed feet,

And staples, in the Song,

The Horror welcomes her, again,

These, are not brayed of Tongue&mdash; Emily Dickinson





The Soul Selects Her Own Society

The Soul selects her own Society --

Then -- shuts the Door --

To her divine Majority --

Present no more --

Unmoved -- she notes the Chariots -- pausing --

At her low Gate --

Unmoved -- an Emperor be kneeling

Upon her Mat --

I've known her -- from an ample nation --

Choose One --

Then -- close the Valves of her attention --

Like Stone --

Emily Dickinson





The Soul that hath a Guest


The Soul that hath a Guest

Doth seldom go abroad&mdash;

Diviner Crowd at Home&mdash;

Obliterate the need&mdash;

And Courtesy forbid

A Host's departure when

Upon Himself be visiting

The Emperor of Men&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





The Soul unto itself


The Soul unto itself

Is an imperial friend&mdash;

Or the most agonizing Spy&mdash;

An Enemy&mdash;could send&mdash; Secure against its own&mdash;

No treason it can fear&mdash;

Itself&mdash;its Sovereign&mdash;of itself The Soul should stand in Awe&mdash; Emily Dickinson

The Soul's distinct connection


The Soul's distinct connection

With immortality

Is best disclosed by Danger

Or quick Calamity&mdash;

As Lightning on a Landscape

Exhibits Sheets of Place&mdash;

Not yet suspected&mdash;but for Flash&mdash; And Click&mdash;and Suddenness.

Emily Dickinson





The Soul's Superior instants


The Soul's Superior instants

Occur to Her&mdash;alone&mdash; When friend&mdash;and Earth's occasion Have infinite withdrawn&mdash;

Or She&mdash;Herself&mdash;ascended To too remote a Height

For lower Recognition

Than Her Omnipotent&mdash;

This Mortal Abolition

Is seldom&mdash;but as fair

As Apparition&mdash;subject

To Autocratic Air&mdash;

Eternity's disclosure

To favorites&mdash;a few&mdash; Of the Colossal substance

Of Immortality

Emily Dickinson





The Spider holds a Silver Ball

The spider holds a Silver Ball

In unperceived Hands--

And dancing softly to Himself

His Yarn of Pearl--unwinds--

He plies from Nought to Nought--

In unsubstantial Trade--

Supplants our Tapestries with His--

In half the period--

An Hour to rear supreme

His Continents of Light--

Then dangle from the Housewife's Broom--

His Boundaries--forgot--

Emily Dickinson





The Spirit is the Conscious Ear


The Spirit is the Conscious Ear.

We actually Hear

When We inspect&mdash;that's audible&mdash; That is admitted&mdash;Here&mdash; For other Services&mdash;as Sound&mdash; There hangs a smaller Ear

Outside the Castle&mdash;that Contain&mdash; The other&mdash;only&mdash;Hear&mdash; Emily Dickinson






The Sun and Moon must make their haste&mdash; The Stars express around

For in the Zones of Paradise

The Lord alone is burned&mdash;

His Eye, it is the East and West&mdash; The North and South when He

Do concentrate His Countenance

Like Glow Worms, flee away&mdash;

Oh Poor and Far&mdash;

Oh Hindred Eye

That hunted for the Day&mdash;

The Lord a Candle entertains

Entirely for Thee&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





The Sun is gay or stark


The Sun is gay or stark

According to our Deed.

If Merry, He is merrier&mdash;

If eager for the Dead

Or an expended Day

He helped to make too bright

His mighty pleasure suits Us not

It magnifies our Freight

Emily Dickinson






The Sun kept setting&mdash;setting&mdash;still No Hue of Afternoon&mdash;

Upon the Village I perceived

From House to House 'twas Noon&mdash; The Dusk kept dropping&mdash;dropping&mdash;still No Dew upon the Grass&mdash;

But only on my Forehead stopped&mdash; And wandered in my Face&mdash;

My Feet kept drowsing&mdash;drowsing&mdash;still My fingers were awake&mdash;

Yet why so little sound&mdash;Myself Unto my Seeming&mdash;make?

How well I knew the Light before&mdash; I could see it now&mdash;

'Tis Dying&mdash;I am doing&mdash;but I'm not afraid to know&mdash;

The Sun kept stooping&mdash;stooping&mdash;low!

The Hills to meet him rose!

On his side, what Transaction!

On their side, what Repose!

Deeper and deeper grew the stain

Upon the window pane&mdash;

Thicker and thicker stood the feet

Until the Tyrian

Was crowded dense with Armies&mdash; So gay, so Brigadier&mdash;

That I felt martial stirrings

Who once the Cockade wore&mdash;

Charged from my chimney corner&mdash; But Nobody was there!

The Sunrise runs for Both&mdash;

The East&mdash;Her Purple Troth

The Noon unwinds Her Blue

The Veins of other Flowers

The Scarlet Flowers are

Till Nature leisure has for Terms

As "Branch," and "Jugular."

We pass, and she abides.

We conjugate Her Skill

While She creates and federates

Without a syllable.

Emily Dickinson






The Way I read a Letter's&mdash;this&mdash;

'Tis first&mdash;I lock the Door&mdash; And push it with my fingers&mdash;next&mdash; For transport it be sure&mdash;

And then I go the furthest off

To counteract a knock&mdash;

Then draw my little Letter forth

And slowly pick the lock&mdash;

Then&mdash;glancing narrow, at the Wall&mdash; And narrow at the floor

For firm Conviction of a Mouse

Not exorcised before&mdash;

Peruse how infinite I am

To no one that You&mdash;know&mdash; And sigh for lack of Heaven&mdash;but not The Heaven God bestow&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





The Way I read a Letter's—this


The Way I read a Letter's—this—

'Tis first—I lock the Door—

And push it with my fingers—next—

For transport it be sure—

And then I go the furthest off

To counteract a knock—

Then draw my little Letter forth

And slowly pick the lock—

Then—glancing narrow, at the Wall—

And narrow at the floor

For firm Conviction of a Mouse

Not exorcised before—

Peruse how infinite I am

To no one that You—know—

And sigh for lack of Heaven—but not

The Heaven God bestow—

Emily Dickinson





The White Heat

Dare you see a Soul at the White Heat?

Then crouch within the door --

Red -- is the Fire's common tint --

But when the vivid Ore

Has vanquished Flame's conditions,

It quivers from the Forge

Without a color, but the light

Of unanointed Blaze.

Least Village has its Blacksmith

Whose Anvil's even ring

Stands symbol for the finer Forge

That soundless tugs -- within --

Re[f]ining these impatient Ores

With Hammer, and with Blaze

Untile the Designated Light

Repudiate the Forge

Emily Dickinson





The Whole of it came not at once


The Whole of it came not at once&mdash;

'Twas Murder by degrees&mdash;

A Thrust&mdash;and then for Life a chance&mdash; The Bliss to cauterize&mdash;

The Cat reprieves the Mouse

She eases from her teeth

Just long enough for Hope to tease&mdash; Then mashes it to death&mdash;

'Tis Life's award&mdash;to die&mdash; Contenteder if once&mdash;

Than dying half&mdash;then rallying For consciouser Eclipse&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





The Wind begun to knead the Grass


[first version]

The Wind begun to knead the Grass&mdash; As Women do a Dough&mdash;

He flung a Hand full at the Plain&mdash; A Hand full at the Sky&mdash;

The Leaves unhooked themselves from Trees&mdash; And started all abroad&mdash;

The Dust did scoop itself like Hands&mdash; And throw away the Road&mdash;

The Wagons&mdash;quickened on the Street&mdash; The Thunders gossiped low&mdash;

The Lightning showed a Yellow Head&mdash; And then a livid Toe&mdash;

The Birds put up the Bars to Nests&mdash; The Cattle flung to Barns&mdash;

Then came one drop of Giant Rain&mdash; And then, as if the Hands

That held the Dams&mdash;had parted hold&mdash; The Waters Wrecked the Sky&mdash;

But overlooked my Father's House&mdash; Just Quartering a Tree&mdash;

[second version]

The Wind begun to rock the Grass

With threatening Tunes and low&mdash; He threw a Menace at the Earth&mdash; A Menace at the Sky.

The Leaves unhooked themselves from Trees&mdash; And started all abroad

The Dust did scoop itself like Hands

And threw away the Road.

The Wagons quickened on the Streets

The Thunder hurried slow&mdash;

The Lightning showed a Yellow Beak

And then a livid Claw.

The Birds put up the Bars to Nests&mdash; The Cattle fled to Barns&mdash;

There came one drop of Giant Rain

And then as if the Hands

That held the Dams had parted hold

The Waters Wrecked the Sky,

But overlooked my Father's House&mdash; Just quartering a Tree&mdash;





Emily Dickinson





The wind begun to rock the grass

The wind begun to rock the grass

With threatening tunes and low,--

He flung a menace at the earth,

A menace at the sky.

The leaves unhooked themselves from trees And started all abroad;

The dust did scoop itself like hands

And throw away the road.

The wagons quickened on the streets,

The thunder hurried slow;

The lightning showed a yellow beak,

And then a livid claw.

The birds put up the bars to nests,

The cattle fled to barns;

There came one drop of giant rain,

And then, as if the hands

That held the dams had parted hold,

The waters wrecked the sky

But overlooked my father's house,

lust quartering a tree.

Emily Dickinson






The Wind didn't come from the Orchard&mdash;today&mdash; Further than that&mdash;

Nor stop to play with the Hay&mdash; Nor joggle a Hat&mdash;

He's a transitive fellow&mdash;very&mdash; Rely on that&mdash;

If He leave a Bur at the door

We know He has climbed a Fir&mdash; But the Fir is Where&mdash;Declare&mdash; Were you ever there?

If He brings Odors of Clovers&mdash; And that is His business&mdash;not Ours&mdash; Then He has been with the Mowers&mdash; Whetting away the Hours

To sweet pauses of Hay&mdash;

His Way&mdash;of a June Day&mdash; If He fling Sand, and Pebble&mdash; Little Boys Hats&mdash;and Stubble&mdash; With an occasional Steeple&mdash;

And a hoarse "Get out of the way, I say,"

Who'd be the fool to stay?

Would you&mdash;Say&mdash;

Would you be the fool to stay?

Emily Dickinson

The wind trapped like a tired man,

The wind tapped like a tired man,

And like a host, 'Come in,'

I boldly answered; entered then

My residence within

A rapid, footless guest,

To offer whom a chair

Were as impossible as hand

A sofa to the air.

No bone had he to bind him,

His speech was like the push

Of numerous humming-birds at once

From a superior bush.

His countenance a billow,

His fingers, if he pass,

Let go a music, as of tunes

Blown tremulous in glass.

He visited, still flitting;

Then, like a timid man,

Again he tapped--'t was flurriedly--

And I became alone.

The Winters are so short


The Winters are so short&mdash;

I'm hardly justified

In sending all the Birds away&mdash; And moving into Pod&mdash;

Myself&mdash;for scarcely settled&mdash; The Phoebes have begun&mdash;

And then&mdash;it's time to strike my Tent&mdash; And open House&mdash;again&mdash; It's mostly, interruptions&mdash;

My Summer&mdash;is despoiled&mdash; Because there was a Winter&mdash;once&mdash; And al the Cattle&mdash;starved&mdash; And so there was a Deluge&mdash;

And swept the World away&mdash;

But Ararat's a Legend&mdash;now&mdash; And no one credits Noah&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





The Woodpecker

His bill an auger is,

His head, a cap and frill.

He laboreth at every tree,--

A worm his utmost goal.

Emily Dickinson

Their Height in Heaven comforts not


Their Height in Heaven comforts not&mdash; Their Glory&mdash;nought to me&mdash;

'Twas best imperfect&mdash;as it was&mdash; I'm finite&mdash;I can't see&mdash; The House of Supposition&mdash;

The Glimmering Frontier that

Skirts the Acres of Perhaps&mdash; To Me&mdash;shows insecure&mdash; The Wealth I had&mdash;contented me&mdash; If 'twas a meaner size&mdash;

Then I had counted it until

It pleased my narrow Eyes&mdash;

Better than larger values&mdash;

That show however true&mdash;

This timid life of Evidence

Keeps pleading&mdash;"I don't know."

Emily Dickinson






There are two Ripenings&mdash;one&mdash;of sight&mdash; Whose forces Spheric wind

Until the Velvet product

Drop spicy to the ground&mdash;

A homelier maturing&mdash;

A process in the Bur&mdash;

That teeth of Frosts alone disclose

In far October Air.

Emily Dickinson

There came a Day at Summer's full


There came a Day at Summer's full,

Entirely for me&mdash;

I thought that such were for the Saints, Where Resurrections&mdash;be&mdash; The Sun, as common, went abroad,

The flowers, accustomed, blew,

As if no soul the solstice passed

That maketh all things new&mdash;

The time was scarce profaned, by speech&mdash; The symbol of a word

Was needless, as at Sacrament,

The Wardrobe&mdash;of our Lord&mdash; Each was to each The Sealed Church,

Permitted to commune this&mdash;time&mdash; Lest we too awkward show

At Supper of the Lamb.

The Hours slid fast&mdash;as Hours will, Clutched tight, by greedy hands&mdash; So faces on two Decks, look back,

Bound to opposing lands&mdash;

And so when all the time had leaked,

Without external sound

Each bound the Other's Crucifix&mdash; We gave no other Bond&mdash;

Sufficient troth, that we shall rise&mdash; Deposed&mdash;at length, the Grave&mdash; To that new Marriage,

Justified&mdash;through Calvaries of Love&mdash; Emily Dickinson





There came a Wind like a Bugle

There cam a Wind like a Bugle -

It quivered through the Grass

And a Green Chill upon the Heat

So ominous did pass

We barred the Windows and the Doors

As from an Emerald Ghost -

The Doom's electric Moccasin

The very instant passed -

On a strange Mob of panting Trees

And Fences fled away

And Rivers where the Houses ran

Those looked that lived - that Day -

The Bell within the steeple wild

The flying tidings told -

How much can come

And much can go,

And yet abide the World!

Emily Dickinson





There is a finished feeling


There is a finished feeling

Experienced at Graves&mdash;

A leisure of the Future&mdash;

A Wilderness of Size.

By Death's bold Exhibition

Preciser what we are

And the Eternal function

Enabled to infer.

Emily Dickinson





There is a flower that Bees prefer


There is a flower that Bees prefer&mdash; And Butterflies&mdash;desire&mdash; To gain the Purple Democrat

The Humming Bird&mdash;aspire&mdash; And Whatsoever Insect pass&mdash;

A Honey bear away

Proportioned to his several dearth

And her&mdash;capacity&mdash;

Her face be rounder than the Moon

And ruddier than the Gown

Or Orchis in the Pasture&mdash;

Or Rhododendron&mdash;worn&mdash; She doth not wait for June&mdash;

Before the World be Green&mdash;

Her sturdy little Countenance

Against the Wind&mdash;be seen&mdash; Contending with the Grass&mdash;

Near Kinsman to Herself&mdash;

For Privilege of Sod and Sun&mdash; Sweet Litigants for Life&mdash;

And when the Hills be full&mdash;

And newer fashions blow&mdash;

Doth not retract a single spice

For pang of jealousy&mdash;

Her Public&mdash;be the Noon&mdash; Her Providence&mdash;the Sun&mdash; Her Progress&mdash;by the Bee&mdash;proclaimed&mdash; In sovereign&mdash;Swerveless Tune&mdash; The Bravest&mdash;of the Host&mdash; Surrendering&mdash;the last&mdash; Nor even of Defeat&mdash;aware&mdash; What cancelled by the Frost&mdash; Emily Dickinson





There is a June when Corn is cut


There is a June when Corn is cut

And Roses in the Seed&mdash;

A Summer briefer than the first

But tenderer indeed

As should a Face supposed the Grave's

Emerge a single Noon

In the Vermilion that it wore

Affect us, and return&mdash;

Two Seasons, it is said, exist&mdash; The Summer of the Just,

And this of Ours, diversified

With Prospect, and with Frost&mdash; May not our Second with its First

So infinite compare

That We but recollect the one

The other to prefer?

Emily Dickinson





There is a Languor of the Life


There is a Languor of the Life

More imminent than Pain&mdash;

'Tis Pain's Successor&mdash;When the Soul Has suffered all it can&mdash;

A Drowsiness&mdash;diffuses&mdash; A Dimness like a Fog

Envelops Consciousness&mdash;

As Mists&mdash;obliterate a Crag.

The Surgeon&mdash;does not blanch&mdash;at pain His Habit&mdash;is severe&mdash; But tell him that it ceased to feel&mdash; The Creature lying there&mdash;

And he will tell you&mdash;skill is late&mdash; A Mightier than He&mdash;

Has ministered before Him&mdash;

There's no Vitality.

Emily Dickinson





There is a morn by men unseen


There is a morn by men unseen&mdash; Whose maids upon remoter green

Keep their Seraphic May&mdash;

And all day long, with dance and game, And gambol I may never name&mdash; Employ their holiday.

Here to light measure, move the feet

Which walk no more the village street&mdash; Nor by the wood are found&mdash;

Here are the birds that sought the sun When last year's distaff idle hung

And summer's brows were bound.

Ne'er saw I such a wondrous scene&mdash; Ne'er such a ring on such a green&mdash; Nor so serene array&mdash;

As if the stars some summer night

Should swing their cups of Chrysolite&mdash; And revel till the day&mdash;

Like thee to dance&mdash;like thee to sing&mdash; People upon the mystic green&mdash; I ask, each new May Morn.

I wait thy far, fantastic bells&mdash; Unto the different dawn!

Emily Dickinson





There is a pain&mdash;so utter


There is a pain&mdash;so utter&mdash; It swallows substance up&mdash;

Then covers the Abyss with Trance&mdash; So Memory can step

Around&mdash;across&mdash;upon it&mdash; As one within a Swoon&mdash;

Goes safely&mdash;where an open eye&mdash; Would drop Him&mdash;Bone by Bone.

Emily Dickinson





There is a pain—so utter


There is a pain—so utter—

It swallows substance up—

Then covers the Abyss with Trance—

So Memory can step

Around—across—upon it—

As one within a Swoon—

Goes safely—where an open eye—

Would drop Him—Bone by Bone.

Emily Dickinson





There is a Shame of Nobleness


There is a Shame of Nobleness&mdash; Confronting Sudden Pelf&mdash;

A finer Shame of Ecstasy&mdash;

Convicted of Itself&mdash;

A best Disgrace&mdash;a Brave Man feels&mdash; Acknowledged&mdash;of the Brave&mdash; One More&mdash;"Ye Blessed"&mdash;to be told&mdash; But that's&mdash;Behind the Grave&mdash; Emily Dickinson





There is a word


There is a word

Which bears a sword

Can pierce an armed man&mdash;

It hurls its barbed syllables

And is mute again&mdash;

But where it fell

The saved will tell

On patriotic day,

Some epauletted Brother

Gave his breath away.

Wherever runs the breathless sun&mdash; Wherever roams the day&mdash;

There is its noiseless onset&mdash; There is its victory!

Behold the keenest marksman!

The most accomplished shot!

Time's sublimest target

Is a soul "forgot!"

Emily Dickinson





There is an arid Pleasure


There is an arid Pleasure&mdash;

As different from Joy&mdash;

As Frost is different from Dew&mdash; Like element&mdash;are they&mdash; Yet one&mdash;rejoices Flowers&mdash; And one&mdash;the Flowers abhor&mdash; The finest Honey&mdash;curdled&mdash; Is worthless&mdash;to the Bee&mdash; Emily Dickinson





There is another sky


There is another sky,

Ever serene and fair,

And there is another sunshine,

Though it be darkness there;

Never mind faded forests, Austin,

Never mind silent fields&mdash;

Here is a little forest,

Whose leaf is ever green;

Here is a brighter garden,

Where not a frost has been;

In its unfading flowers

I hear the bright bee hum:

Prithee, my brother,

Into my garden come!

Emily Dickinson





There is no frigate like a book

There is no frigate like a book

To take us lands away,

Nor any coursers like a page

Of prancing poetry.

This traverse may the poorest take

Without oppress of toll;

How frugal is the chariot

That bears a human soul!

Emily Dickinson





There's a certain Slant of light

There's a certain Slant of light,

Winter Afternoons--

That opresses, like the Heft

Of Cathedral Tunes--

Heavenly Hurt, it gives us--

We can find no scar,

But internal difference,

Where the meanings are--

None may teach it--Any--

'Tis the Seal Despair--

An imperial affliction

Sent us of the Air--

When it comes, the Landscape listens--

Shadows--hold their breath--

When it goes, 'tis like the Distance

On the look of Death--

Emily Dickinson

There's a certain slant of light,

There's a certain slant of light,

On winter afternoons

That oppresses, lik the weight

Of cathedral tunes.

Heavenly hurt it gives us;

We can find no scar,

But internal difference

Where the meanings, are.

None may teach it anything,

'T is the seal, despair, --

An imperial affliction

Sent us of the air.

Shadows hold their breath;

When it goes, 't is like the distance

On the look of death.

Emily Dickinson





There's been a death in the opposite house There's been a death in the opposite house As lately as to-day.

I know it by the numb look

Such houses have alway.

The neighbors rustle in and out,

The doctor drives away.

A window opens like a pod,

Abrupt, mechanically;

Somebody flings a mattress out,--

The children hurry by;

They wonder if It died on that,--

I used to when a boy.

The minister goes stiffly in

As if the house were his,

And he owned all the mourners now,

And little boys besides;

And then the milliner, and the man

Of the appalling trade,

To take the measure of the house.

There'll be that dark parade

Of tassels and of coaches soon;

It's easy as a sign,--

The intuition of the news

In just a country town.

Emily Dickinson

There's something quieter than sleep


There's something quieter than sleep

Within this inner room!

It wears a sprig upon its breast&mdash; And will not tell its name.

Some touch it, and some kiss it&mdash; Some chafe its idle hand&mdash;

It has a simple gravity

I do not understand!

I would not weep if I were they&mdash; How rude in one to sob!

Might scare the quiet fairy

Back to her native wood!

While simple-hearted neighbors

Chat of the "Early dead"&mdash; We&mdash;prone to periphrasis

Remark that Birds have fled!

Emily Dickinson






These are the days when Birds come back&mdash; A very few&mdash;a Bird or two&mdash; To take a backward look.

These are the days when skies resume

The old&mdash;old sophistries of June&mdash; A blue and gold mistake.

Oh fraud that cannot cheat the Bee&mdash; Almost thy plausibility

Induces my belief.

Till ranks of seeds their witness bear&mdash; And softly thro' the altered air

Hurries a timid leaf.

Oh Sacrament of summer days,

Oh Last Communion in the Haze&mdash; Permit a child to join.

Thy sacred emblems to partake&mdash; They consecrated bread to take

And thine immortal wine!

Emily Dickinson





These tested Our Horizon


These tested Our Horizon&mdash;

Then disappeared

As Birds before achieving

A Latitude.

Our Retrospection of Them

A fixed Delight,

But our Anticipation

A Dice&mdash;a Doubt&mdash;

They ask but our Delight


They ask but our Delight&mdash;

The Darlings of the Soil

And grant us all their Countenance

For a penurious smile.

Emily Dickinson





They called me to the Window, for


They called me to the Window, for

" 'Twas Sunset"&mdash;Some one said&mdash; I only saw a Sapphire Farm&mdash;

And just a Single Herd&mdash;

Of Opal Cattle&mdash;feeding far

Upon so vain a Hill&mdash;

As even while I looked&mdash;dissolved&mdash; Nor Cattle were&mdash;nor Soil&mdash; But in their stead&mdash;a Sea&mdash;displayed&mdash; And Ships&mdash;of such a size

As Crew of Mountains&mdash;could afford&mdash; And Decks&mdash;to seat the skies&mdash; This&mdash;too&mdash;the Showman rubbed away&mdash; And when I looked again&mdash;

Nor Farm&mdash;nor Opal Herd&mdash;was there&mdash; Nor Mediterranean&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





They dropped like flakes

They dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars, Like petals from a rose,

When suddenly across the lune

A wind with fingers goes.

They perished in the seamless grass,--

No eye could find the place;

But God on his repealless list

Can summon every face

Emily Dickinson

Emily Dickinson





They have not chosen me, he said,

"They have not chosen me," he said,

"But I have chosen them!"

Brave—Broken hearted statement—

Uttered in Bethlehem!

I could not have told it,

But since Jesus dared—

Sovereign! Know a Daisy

They dishonor shared!

Emily Dickinson





They leave us with the Infinite


They leave us with the Infinite.

But He&mdash;is not a man&mdash; His fingers are the size of fists&mdash; His fists, the size of men&mdash;

And whom he foundeth, with his Arm

As Himmaleh, shall stand&mdash;

Gibraltar's Everlasting Shoe

Poised lightly on his Hand,

So trust him, Comrade&mdash;

You for you, and I, for you and me

Eternity is ample,

And quick enough, if true.

Emily Dickinson





They put Us far apart


They put Us far apart&mdash;

As separate as Sea

And Her unsown Peninsula&mdash;

We signified "These see"&mdash; They took away our Eyes&mdash;

They thwarted Us with Guns&mdash;

"I see Thee" each responded straight Through Telegraphic Signs&mdash;

With Dungeons&mdash;They devised&mdash; But through their thickest skill&mdash; And their opaquest Adamant&mdash;

Our Souls saw&mdash;just as well&mdash; They summoned Us to die&mdash;

With sweet alacrity

We stood upon our stapled feet&mdash; Condemned&mdash;but just&mdash;to see&mdash; Permission to recant&mdash;

Permission to forget&mdash;

They say that "Time assuages"


They say that "Time assuages"&mdash; Time never did assuage&mdash;

An actual suffering strengthens

As Sinews do, with age&mdash;

Time is a Test of Trouble&mdash;

But not a Remedy&mdash;

If such it prove, it prove too

There was no Malady&mdash;

Emily Dickinson

They say that 'time assuages,

They say that 'time assuages,'--

Time never did assuage;

An actual suffering strengthens,

As sinews do, with age.

Time is a test of trouble,

But not a remedy.

If such it prove, it prove too

There was no malady.

They Shut Me Up in Prose

They shut me up in Prose --

As when a little Girl

They put me in the Closet --

Because they liked me "still" --

Still! Could themself have peeped --

And seen my Brain -- go round --

They might as wise have lodged a Bird

For Treason -- in the Pound --

Himself has but to will

And easy as a Star

Abolish his Captivity --

And laugh -- No more have I --

Emily Dickinson






They won't frown always&mdash;some sweet Day When I forget to tease&mdash;

They'll recollect how cold I looked

And how I just said "Please."

Then They will hasten to the Door

To call the little Girl

Who cannot thank Them for the Ice

That filled the lisping full.

Emily Dickinson

This Bauble was preferred of Bees


This Bauble was preferred of Bees&mdash; By Butterflies admired

At Heavenly&mdash;Hopeless Distances&mdash; Was justified of Bird&mdash;

Did Noon&mdash;enamel&mdash;in Herself Was Summer to a Score

Who only knew of Universe&mdash;

It had created Her.

Emily Dickinson





This Chasm, Sweet, upon my life


This Chasm, Sweet, upon my life

I mention it to you,

When Sunrise through a fissure drop

The Day must follow too.

If we demur, its gaping sides

Disclose as 'twere a Tomb

Ourself am lying straight wherein

The Favorite of Doom.

When it has just contained a Life

Then, Darling, it will close

And yet so bolder every Day

So turbulent it grows

I'm tempted half to stitch it up

With a remaining Breath

I should not miss in yielding, though

To Him, it would be Death&mdash;

And so I bear it big about

My Burial&mdash;before

A Life quite ready to depart

Can harass me no more&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





This Consciousness that is aware


This Consciousness that is aware

Of Neighbors and the Sun

Will be the one aware of Death

And that itself alone

Is traversing the interval

Experience between

And most profound experiment

Appointed unto Men&mdash;

How adequate unto itself

Its properties shall be

Itself unto itself and none

Shall make discovery.

Adventure most unto itself

The Soul condemned to be&mdash;

Attended by a single Hound

Its own identity.

Emily Dickinson





This Dust, and its Feature


This Dust, and its Feature&mdash;

Accredited&mdash;Today&mdash;

Will in a second Future&mdash;

Cease to identify&mdash;

This Mind, and its measure&mdash;

A too minute Area

For its enlarged inspection's

Comparison&mdash;appear&mdash; This World, and its species

A too concluded show

For its absorbed Attention's

Remotest scrutiny&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





This heart that broke so long


This heart that broke so long&mdash; These feet that never flagged&mdash; This faith that watched for star in vain, Give gently to the dead&mdash;

Hound cannot overtake the Hare

That fluttered panting, here&mdash; Nor any schoolboy rob the nest

Tenderness builded there.

Emily Dickinson





This is a Blossom of the Brain


This is a Blossom of the Brain&mdash; A small&mdash;italic Seed

Lodged by Design or Happening

The Spirit fructified&mdash;

Shy as the Wind of his Chambers

Swift as a Freshet's Tongue

So of the Flower of the Soul

Its process is unknown.

When it is found, a few rejoice

The Wise convey it Home

Carefully cherishing the spot

If other Flower become.

When it is lost, that Day shall be

The Funeral of God,

Upon his Breast, a closing Soul

The Flower of our Lord.

Emily Dickinson





This is My Letter to the World

This is my letter to the World

That never wrote to Me --

The simple News that Nature told --

With tender Majesty

Her Message is committed

To Hands I cannot see --

For love of Her -- Sweet -- countrymen --

Judge tenderly -- of Me

Emily Dickinson





This is my letter to the world,

This is my letter to the world,

That never wrote to me,--

To hands I cannot see;

For love of her, sweet countrymen,

Judge tenderly of me!

This is the land the sunset washes,

This is the land the sunset washes,

These are the banks of the Yellow Sea; Where it rose, or whither it rushes,

These are the western mystery!

Night after night her purple traffic

Strews the landing with opal bales;

Merchantmen poise upon horizons,

Dip, and vanish with fairy sails.

Emily Dickinson





This Merit hath the worst


This Merit hath the worst&mdash;

It cannot be again&mdash;

When Fate hath taunted last

And thrown Her furthest Stone&mdash; The Maimed may pause, and breathe,

And glance securely round&mdash;

The Deer attracts no further

Than it resists&mdash;the Hound&mdash; Emily Dickinson






This quiet Dust was Gentleman and Ladies And Lads and Girls&mdash;

Was laughter and ability and Sighing

And Frocks and Curls.

This Passive Place a Summer's nimble mansion Where Bloom and Bees

Exists an Oriental Circuit

Then cease, like these&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





This Quiet Dust was Gentlemen and Ladies This quiet dust was gentlemen and ladies And lads and girls;

Was laughter and ability and sighing,

And frocks and curls;

This passive place a summer's nimble mansion, Where bloom and bees

Fulfilled their oriental circuit,

Then ceased like these.

This that would greet&mdash;an hour ago&mdash; Is quaintest Distance&mdash;now&mdash; Had it a Guest from Paradise&mdash; Nor glow, would it, nor bow&mdash; Had it a notice from the Noon

This was a Poet&mdash;It is That

This was in the White of the Year


This was in the White of the Year&mdash; That&mdash;was in the Green&mdash; Drifts were as difficult then to think As Daisies now to be seen&mdash;

Looking back is best that is left

Or if it be&mdash;before&mdash; Retrospection is Prospect's half,

Sometimes, almost more.

Emily Dickinson





This World is not Conclusion


This World is not Conclusion.

A Species stands beyond&mdash;

Invisible, as Music&mdash;

But positive, as Sound&mdash;

It beckons, and it baffles&mdash;

Philosophy&mdash;don't know&mdash; And through a Riddle, at the last&mdash; Sagacity, must go&mdash;

To guess it, puzzles scholars&mdash; To gain it, Men have borne

Contempt of Generations

And Crucifixion, shown&mdash;

Faith slips&mdash;and laughs, and rallies&mdash; Blushes, if any see&mdash;

Plucks at a twig of Evidence&mdash; And asks a Vane, the way&mdash;

Much Gesture, from the Pulpit&mdash; Strong Hallelujahs roll&mdash;

Narcotics cannot still the Tooth

That nibbles at the soul&mdash;

Tho' I get home how late&mdash;how late&mdash; So I get home - 'twill compensate&mdash; Better will be the Ecstasy

That they have done expecting me&mdash; When Night&mdash;descending&mdash;dumb&mdash;and dark&mdash; They hear my unexpected knock&mdash; Transporting must the moment be&mdash; Brewed from decades of Agony!

To think just how the fire will burn&mdash; Just how long-cheated eyes will turn&mdash; To wonder what myself will say,

Tho' my destiny be Fustian


Tho' my destiny be Fustian&mdash;

Hers be damask fine&mdash;

Tho' she wear a silver apron&mdash; I, a less divine&mdash;

Still, my little Gypsy being

I would far prefer,

Still, my little sunburnt bosom

To her Rosier,

For, when Frosts, their punctual fingers On her forehead lay,

You and I, and Dr. Holland,

Bloom Eternally!

Roses of a steadfast summer

In a steadfast land,

Where no Autumn lifts her pencil&mdash; And no Reapers stand!

Through lane it lay&mdash;through bramble&mdash; Through clearing and through wood&mdash; Banditti often passed us

Upon the lonely road.

The wolf came peering curious&mdash; The owl looked puzzled down&mdash; The serpent's satin figure

Glid stealthily along&mdash;

The tempests touched our garments&mdash; The lightning's poinards gleamed&mdash; Fierce from the Crag above us

The hungry Vulture screamed&mdash; The satyr's fingers beckoned&mdash; The valley murmured "Come"&mdash; These were the mates&mdash;

This was the road

Those children fluttered home.

Tie the Strings to my Life, My Lord


Tie the Strings to my Life, My Lord,

Then, I am ready to go!

Just a look at the Horses&mdash;

Rapid! That will do!

Put me in on the firmest side&mdash; So I shall never fall&mdash;

For we must ride to the Judgment&mdash; And it's partly, down Hill&mdash;

But never I mind the steeper&mdash; And never I mind the Sea&mdash;

Held fast in Everlasting Race&mdash; By my own Choice, and Thee&mdash;

Goodbye to the Life I used to live&mdash; And the World I used to know&mdash; And kiss the Hills, for me, just once&mdash; Then&mdash;I am ready to go!

So I shall never fall;

For we must ride to the Judgment,

And it's partly down hill.

But never I mind the bridges,

And never I mind the sea;

Held fast in everlasting race

By my own choice and thee.

Good-by to the life I used to lives,

And the world I used to know;

And kiss the hills for me, just once;

Now I am ready to go!

'Tis so much joy! 'Tis so much joy!


'Tis so much joy! 'Tis so much joy!

If I should fail, what poverty!

And yet, as poor as I,

Have ventured all upon a throw!

Have gained! Yes! Hesitated so&mdash; This side the Victory!

Life is but Life! And Death, but Death!

Bliss is, but Bliss, and Breath but Breath!

And if indeed I fail,

At least, to know the worst, is sweet!

Defeat means nothing but Defeat,

No drearier, can befall!

And if I gain! Oh Gun at Sea!

Oh Bells, that in the Steeples be!

At first, repeat it slow!

For Heaven is a different thing,

Conjectured, and waked sudden in&mdash; And might extinguish me!

To die

To die--takes just a little while--

They say it doesn't hurt--

It's only fainter--by degrees--

And then--it's out of sight--

A darker Ribbon--for a Day--

A Crape upon the Hat--

And then the pretty sunshine comes--

And helps us to forget--

The absent--mystic--creature--

That but for love of us--

Had gone to sleep--that soundest time--

Without the weariness--

To fight aloud, is very brave


To fight aloud, is very brave&mdash; But gallanter, I know

Who charge within the bosom

The Cavalry of Woe&mdash;

Who win, and nations do not see&mdash; Who fall&mdash;and none observe&mdash; Whose dying eyes, no Country

Regards with patriot love&mdash;

We trust, in plumed procession

For such, the Angels go&mdash;

Rank after Rank, with even feet&mdash; And Uniforms of Snow.

Emily Dickinson





To fill a Gap


To fill a Gap

Insert the Thing that caused it&mdash; Block it up

With Other&mdash;and 'twill yawn the more&mdash; You cannot solder an Abyss

With Air.

To hang our head&mdash;ostensibly


To hang our head&mdash;ostensibly&mdash; And subsequent, to find

That such was not the posture

Of our immortal mind&mdash;

Affords the sly presumption

That in so dense a fuzz&mdash;

You&mdash;too&mdash;take Cobweb attitudes Upon a plane of Gauze!

To hear an Oriole sing


To hear an Oriole sing

May be a common thing&mdash;

Or only a divine.

It is not of the Bird

Who sings the same, unheard,

As unto Crowd&mdash;

The Fashion of the Ear

Attireth that it hear

In Dun, or fair&mdash;

So whether it be Rune,

Or whether it be none

Is of within.

The "Tune is in the Tree&mdash;"

The Skeptic&mdash;showeth me&mdash;

"No Sir! In Thee!"

Emily Dickinson





To interrupt His Yellow Plan


To interrupt His Yellow Plan

The Sun does not allow

Caprices of the Atmosphere&mdash;

And even when the Snow

Heaves Balls of Specks, like Vicious Boy Directly in His Eye&mdash;

Does not so much as turn His Head

Busy with Majesty&mdash;

'Tis His to stimulate the Earth&mdash; And magnetize the Sea&mdash;

And bind Astronomy, in place,

Yet Any passing by

Would deem Ourselves&mdash;the busier As the Minutest Bee

That rides&mdash;emits a Thunder&mdash; A Bomb&mdash;to justify&mdash; Emily Dickinson






To know just how He suffered&mdash;would be dear&mdash; To know if any Human eyes were near

To whom He could entrust His wavering gaze&mdash; Until it settle broad&mdash;on Paradise&mdash; To know if He was patient&mdash;part content&mdash; Was Dying as He thought&mdash;or different&mdash; Was it a pleasant Day to die&mdash; And did the Sunshine face his way&mdash; What was His furthest mind&mdash;Of Home&mdash;or God&mdash; Or what the Distant say&mdash;

At news that He ceased Human Nature

Such a Day&mdash;

And Wishes&mdash;Had He Any&mdash; Just His Sigh&mdash;Accented&mdash; Had been legible&mdash;to Me&mdash; And was He Confident until

Ill fluttered out&mdash;in Everlasting Well&mdash; And if He spoke&mdash;What name was Best&mdash; What last

What One broke off with

At the Drowsiest&mdash;

Was He afraid&mdash;or tranquil&mdash; Might He know

How Conscious Consciousness&mdash;could grow&mdash; Till Love that was&mdash;and Love too best to be&mdash; Meet&mdash;and the Junction be Eternity Emily Dickinson






To know just how He suffered—would be dear—

To know if any Human eyes were near

To whom He could entrust His wavering gaze—

Until it settle broad—on Paradise—

To know if He was patient—part content—

Was Dying as He thought—or different—

Was it a pleasant Day to die—

And did the Sunshine face his way—

What was His furthest mind—Of Home—or God—

Or what the Distant say—

At news that He ceased Human Nature

Such a Day—

And Wishes—Had He Any—

Just His Sigh—Accented—

Had been legible—to Me—

And was He Confident until

Ill fluttered out—in Everlasting Well—

And if He spoke—What name was Best—

To learn the Transport by the Pain


To learn the Transport by the Pain

As Blind Men learn the sun!

To die of thirst&mdash;suspecting

That Brooks in Meadows run!

To stay the homesick&mdash;homesick feet Upon a foreign shore&mdash;

Haunted by native lands, the while&mdash; And blue&mdash;beloved air!

This is the Sovereign Anguish!

This&mdash;the signal woe!

These are the patient "Laureates"

Whose voices&mdash;trained&mdash;below&mdash; Ascend in ceaseless Carol&mdash;

Inaudible, indeed,

To us&mdash;the duller scholars

Of the Mysterious Bard!

Emily Dickinson





To lose one's faith&mdash;surpass


To lose one's faith&mdash;surpass

The loss of an Estate&mdash;

Because Estates can be

And Being's&mdash;Beggary&mdash; Emily Dickinson

To love thee Year by Year


To love thee Year by Year&mdash;

May less appear

Than sacrifice, and cease&mdash;

However, dear,

Forever might be short, I thought to show&mdash; And so I pieced it, with a flower, now.

Emily Dickinson






To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, One clover, and a bee.

And revery.

The revery alone will do,

If bees are few.

Emily Dickinson






To make One's Toilette&mdash;after Death Has made the Toilette cool

Of only Taste we cared to please

Is difficult, and still&mdash;

That's easier&mdash;than Braid the Hair&mdash; And make the Bodice gay&mdash;

When eyes that fondled it are wrenched By Decalogues&mdash;away&mdash; Emily Dickinson





To my quick ear the leaves conferred;

To my quick ear the leaves conferred;

The bushes they were bells;

I could not find a privacy

From Nature's sentinels.

In cave if I presumed to hide,

The walls began to tell;

Creation seemed a mighty crack

To make me visible.

Emily Dickinson






To my quick ear the Leaves&mdash;conferred&mdash; The Bushes&mdash;they were Bells&mdash; I could not find a Privacy

To my small Hearth His fire came


To my small Hearth His fire came&mdash; And all my House aglow

Did fan and rock, with sudden light&mdash;

'Twas Sunrise&mdash;'twas the Sky&mdash; Impanelled from no Summer brief&mdash; With limit of Decay&mdash;

'Twas Noon&mdash;without the News of Night&mdash; Nay, Nature, it was Day&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





To offer brave assistance


To offer brave assistance

To Lives that stand alone&mdash;

When One has failed to stop them&mdash; Is Human&mdash;but Divine

To lend an Ample Sinew

Unto a Nameless Man&mdash;

Whose Homely Benediction

No other&mdash;stopped to earn&mdash; Emily Dickinson





To One denied the drink


To One denied the drink

To tell what Water is

Would be acuter, would it not

Than letting Him surmise?

To lead Him to the Well

And let Him hear it drip

Remind Him, would it not, somewhat

Of His condemned lip?

Emily Dickinson





To own the Art within the Soul


To own the Art within the Soul

The Soul to entertain

With Silence as a Company

And Festival maintain

Is an unfurnished Circumstance

Possession is to One

As an Estate perpetual

Or a reduceless Mine.

Emily Dickinson





To put this World down, like a Bundle


To put this World down, like a Bundle&mdash; And walk steady, away,

Requires Energy&mdash;possibly Agony&mdash;

'Tis the Scarlet way

Trodden with straight renunciation

By the Son of God&mdash;

Later, his faint Confederates

Justify the Road&mdash;

Flavors of that old Crucifixion&mdash; Filaments of Bloom, Pontius Pilate sowed&mdash; Strong Clusters, from Barabbas' Tomb&mdash; Sacrament, Saints partook before us&mdash; Patent, every drop,

With the Brand of the Gentile Drinker

Who indorsed the Cup&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





To this World she returned


To this World she returned.

But with a tinge of that&mdash;

A Compound manner,

As a Sod

Espoused a Violet,

That chiefer to the Skies

Than to himself, allied,

Dwelt hesitating, half of Dust,

And half of Day, the Bride.

Emily Dickinson





To venerate the simple days


To venerate the simple days

Which lead the seasons by,

Needs but to remember

That from you or I,

They may take the trifle

Termed mortality!

To wait an Hour&mdash;is long


To wait an Hour&mdash;is long&mdash; If Love be just beyond&mdash;

To wait Eternity&mdash;is short&mdash; If Love reward the end&mdash;

To wait an Hour—is long—

Too little way the House must lie


Too little way the House must lie

From every Human Heart

That holds in undisputed Lease

A white inhabitant&mdash;

Too narrow is the Right between&mdash; Too imminent the chance&mdash;

Each Consciousness must emigrate

And lose its neighbor once&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Train

I like to see it lap the miles,

And lick the valleys up,

And stop to feed itself at tanks;

And then, prodigious, step

Around a pile of mountains,

And, supercilious, peer

In shanties by the sides of roads;

And then a quarry pare

To fit its sides, and crawl between,

Complaining all the while

In horrid, hooting stanza;

Then chase itself down the hill

And neigh like Boanerges;

Then, punctual as a star,

Stop - docile and omnipotent -

At its own stable door.

Emily Dickinson

Trust in the Unexpected


Trust in the Unexpected&mdash;

By this&mdash;was William Kidd

Persuaded of the Buried Gold&mdash; As One had testified&mdash;

Through this&mdash;the old Philosopher&mdash; His Talismanic Stone

Discern&eacute;d&mdash;still withholden To effort undivine&mdash;

'Twas this&mdash;allured Columbus&mdash; When Genoa&mdash;withdrew

Before an Apparition

Baptized America&mdash;

The Same&mdash;afflicted Thomas&mdash; When Deity assured

'Twas better&mdash;the perceiving not&mdash; Provided it believed&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Truth&mdash;is as old as God


Truth&mdash;is as old as God&mdash; His Twin identity

And will endure as long as He

A Co-Eternity&mdash;

And perish on the Day

Himself is borne away

From Mansion of the Universe

A lifeless Deity.

Emily Dickinson

'Twas a long Parting&mdash;but the time For Interview&mdash;had Come&mdash; Before the Judgment Seat of God&mdash; The last&mdash;and second time

'Twas awkward, but it fitted me


'Twas awkward, but it fitted me&mdash; An Ancient fashioned Heart&mdash;

Its only lore&mdash;its Steadfastness&mdash; In Change&mdash;unerudite&mdash; It only moved as do the Suns&mdash; For merit of Return&mdash;

Or Birds&mdash;confirmed perpetual By Alternating Zone&mdash;

I only have it not Tonight

In its established place&mdash;

For technicality of Death&mdash;

Omitted in the Lease&mdash;

'Twas Crisis&mdash;All the length had passed&mdash; That dull&mdash;benumbing time

There is in Fever or Event&mdash;

And now the Chance had come&mdash; The instant holding in its claw

The privilege to live

Or warrant to report the Soul

The other side the Grave.

The Muscles grappled as with leads

That would not let the Will&mdash; The Spirit shook the Adamant&mdash; But could not make it feel.

The Second poised&mdash;debated&mdash;shot&mdash; Another had begun&mdash;

And simultaneously, a Soul

Escaped the House unseen&mdash;

'Twas just this time, last year, I died.

I know I heard the Corn,

When I was carried by the Farms&mdash; It had the Tassels on&mdash;

I thought how yellow it would look&mdash; When Richard went to mill&mdash;

And then, I wanted to get out,

But something held my will.

I thought just how Red&mdash;Apples wedged The Stubble's joints between&mdash; And the Carts stooping round the fields To take the Pumpkins in&mdash;

I wondered which would miss me, least, And when Thanksgiving, came,

If Father'd multiply the plates&mdash; To make an even Sum&mdash;

And would it blur the Christmas glee

My Stocking hang too high

For any Santa Claus to reach

The Altitude of me&mdash;

But this sort, grieved myself,

And so, I thought the other way,

How just this time, some perfect year&mdash; Themself, should come to me&mdash; Emily Dickinson





'Twas like a Maelstrom, with a notch


'Twas like a Maelstrom, with a notch,

That nearer, every Day,

Kept narrowing its boiling Wheel

Until the Agony

Toyed coolly with the final inch

Of your delirious Hem&mdash;

And you dropt, lost,

When something broke&mdash;

And let you from a Dream&mdash;

As if a Goblin with a Gauge&mdash; Kept measuring the Hours&mdash;

Until you felt your Second

Weigh, helpless, in his Paws&mdash; And not a Sinew&mdash;stirred&mdash;could help, And sense was setting numb&mdash;

When God&mdash;remembered&mdash;and the Fiend Let go, then, Overcome&mdash;

As if your Sentence stood&mdash;pronounced&mdash; And you were frozen led

From Dungeon's luxury of Doubt

To Gibbets, and the Dead&mdash;

And when the Film had stitched your eyes A Creature gasped "Reprieve"!

Which Anguish was the utterest&mdash;then&mdash; To perish, or to live?

Emily Dickinson





'Twas Love&mdash;not me

Just Him&mdash;not me&mdash;

Such Guilt&mdash;to love Thee&mdash;most!

Doom it beyond the Rest&mdash;

Forgive it&mdash;last&mdash;

'Twas base as Jesus&mdash;most!

Let Justice not mistake&mdash;

We Two&mdash;looked so alike&mdash; Which was the Guilty Sake&mdash;

'Twas Love's&mdash;Now Strike!

'Twas such a little&mdash;little boat That toddled down the bay!

That licked it from the Coast&mdash; Nor ever guessed the stately sails

My little craft was lost!

'Twas warm&mdash;at first&mdash;like Us&mdash; Until there crept upon

A Chill&mdash;like frost upon a Glass&mdash; Till all the scene&mdash;be gone.

The Forehead copied Stone&mdash;

The Fingers grew too cold

To ache&mdash;and like a Skater's Brook&mdash; The busy eyes&mdash;congealed&mdash; It straightened&mdash;that was all&mdash; It crowded Cold to Cold&mdash;

It multiplied indifference&mdash;

As Pride were all it could&mdash;

And even when with Cords&mdash;

'Twas lowered, like a Weight&mdash; It made no Signal, nor demurred,

But dropped like Adamant.

Two butterflies went out at noon

Two butterflies went out at noon

And waltzed above a stream,

Then stepped straight through the firmament And rested on a beam;

And then together bore away

Upon a shining sea,--

Though never yet, in any port

Their coming mentioned be.

If spoken by the distant bird,

If met in ether sea

By frigate or by merchantman,

Report was not to me.

Emily Dickinson





Two swimmers wrestled on the spar


Two swimmers wrestled on the spar&mdash; Until the morning sun&mdash;

When One&mdash;turned smiling to the land&mdash; Oh God! the Other One!

Upon the waters borne&mdash;

With eyes in death&mdash;still begging raised&mdash; And hands&mdash;beseeching&mdash;thrown!

Two Travellers perishing in Snow


Two Travellers perishing in Snow

The Forests as they froze

Together heard them strengthening

Each other with the words

That Heaven if Heaven&mdash;must contain What Either left behind

And then the cheer too solemn grew

For language, and the wind

Long steps across the features took

That Love had touched the Morn

With reverential Hyacinth&mdash;

The taleless Days went on

Till Mystery impatient drew

And those They left behind

Led absent, were procured of Heaven

As Those first furnished, said&mdash; Emily Dickinson

Under the Light, yet under


Under the Light, yet under,

Under the Grass and the Dirt,

Under the Beetle's Cellar

Under the Clover's Root,

Further than Arm could stretch

Were it Giant long,

Further than Sunshine could

Were the Day Year long,

Over the Light, yet over,

Over the Arc of the Bird&mdash;

Over the Comet's chimney&mdash;

Over the Cubit's Head,

Further than Guess can gallop

Further than Riddle ride&mdash;

Oh for a Disc to the Distance

Between Ourselves and the Dead!

Such spirit makes her perpetual mention, That I—grown bold—

Step martial—at my Crucifixion—

As Trumpets—rolled—

Feet, small as mine—have marched in Revolution Firm to the Drum—

Hands—not so stout—hoisted them—in witness—

When Speech went numb—

Let me not shame their sublime deportments—

Drilled bright—

Beckoning—Etruscan invitation—

Toward Light—

Emily Dickinson





Unto Me? I do not know you—

"Unto Me?" I do not know you—

Where may be your House?

"I am Jesus—Late of Judea—

Now—of Paradise"—

Wagons—have you—to convey me?

This is far from Thence—

"Arms of Mine—sufficient Phaeton—

Trust Omnipotence"—

I am spotted—"I am Pardon"—

I am small—"The Least

Is esteemed in Heaven the Chiefest—

Occupy my House"—

Emily Dickinson

Upon Concluded Lives


Upon Concluded Lives

There's nothing cooler falls&mdash; Than Life's sweet Calculations&mdash; The mixing Bells and Palls&mdash;

Victory comes late


Victory comes late&mdash;

And is held low to freezing lips&mdash; Too rapt with frost

To take it&mdash;

How sweet it would have tasted&mdash; Just a Drop&mdash;

Was God so economical?

His Table's spread too high for Us&mdash; Unless We dine on tiptoe&mdash;

Crumbs&mdash;fit such little mouths&mdash; Cherries&mdash;suit Robbins&mdash; The Eagle's Golden Breakfast strangles&mdash;Them&mdash; God keep His Oath to Sparrows&mdash; Who of little Love&mdash;know how to starve&mdash; Emily Dickinson





Victory comes late,

Victory comes late,

And is held low to freezing lips

Too rapt with frost

To take it.

How sweet it would have tasted,

Just a drop!

Was God so economical?

His table's spread too high for us

Unless we dine on tip-toe.

Crumbs fit such little mouths,

Cherries suit robins;

The eagle's golden breakfast

Strangles them.

God keeps his oath to sparrows,

Who of little love

Know how to starve!

Emily Dickinson





Wait till the Majesty of Death


Wait till the Majesty of Death

Invests so mean a brow!

Almost a powdered Footman

Might dare to touch it now!

Wait till in Everlasting Robes

That Democrat is dressed,

Then prate about "Preferment"&mdash; And "Station," and the rest!

Around this quiet Courtier

Obsequious Angels wait!

Full royal is his Retinue!

Full purple is his state!

A Lord, might dare to lift the Hat

To such a Modest Clay

Since that My Lord, "the Lord of Lords"

Receives unblushingly!

Emily Dickinson





Water, is taught by thirst


Water, is taught by thirst.

Land&mdash;by the Oceans passed.

Transport&mdash;by throe&mdash; Peace&mdash;by its battles told&mdash; Love, by Memorial Mold&mdash;

Birds, by the Snow.

Emily Dickinson





We can but follow to the Sun


We can but follow to the Sun&mdash; As oft as He go down

He leave Ourselves a Sphere behind&mdash;

'Tis mostly&mdash;following&mdash; We go no further with the Dust

Than to the Earthen Door&mdash;

And then the Panels are reversed&mdash; And we behold&mdash;no more.

Emily Dickinson





We Cover Thee&mdash;Sweet Face


We Cover Thee&mdash;Sweet Face&mdash; Not that We tire of Thee&mdash;

But that Thyself fatigue of Us&mdash; Remember&mdash;as Thou go&mdash; We follow Thee until

Thou notice Us&mdash;no more&mdash; And then&mdash;reluctant&mdash;turn away To Con Thee o'er and o'er&mdash;

And blame the scanty love

We were Content to show&mdash;

Augmented&mdash;Sweet&mdash;a Hundred fold&mdash; If Thou would'st take it&mdash;now&mdash; Emily Dickinson

We do not play on Graves


We do not play on Graves&mdash;

Because there isn't Room&mdash;

Besides&mdash;it isn't even&mdash;it slants And People come&mdash;

And put a Flower on it&mdash;

And hang their faces so&mdash;

We're fearing that their Hearts will drop&mdash; And crush our pretty play&mdash;

And so we move as far

As Enemies&mdash;away&mdash;

Just looking round to see how far

It is&mdash;Occasionally&mdash; Emily Dickinson





We don't cry&mdash;Tim and I


We don't cry&mdash;Tim and I,

To prevent a friend&mdash;

Then we hide our brave face

Deep in our hand&mdash;

Not to cry&mdash;Tim and I&mdash; We are far too grand&mdash;

Nor to dream&mdash;he and me&mdash; Do we condescend&mdash;

We just shut our brown eye

To see to the end&mdash;

Tim&mdash;see Cottages&mdash;

But, Oh, so high!

Then&mdash;we shake&mdash;Tim and I&mdash; And lest I&mdash;cry&mdash;

Tim&mdash;reads a little Hymn&mdash; And we both pray&mdash;

Please, Sir, I and Tim&mdash;

Always lost the way!

We must die&mdash;by and by&mdash; Clergymen say&mdash;

We dream—it is good we are dreaming

And Drama—is never dead—

Cautious—We jar each other—

We Grow Accustomed to the Dark

We grow accustomed to the Dark --

When light is put away --

As when the Neighbor holds the Lamp

To witness her Goodbye --

A Moment -- We uncertain step

For newness of the night --

Then -- fit our Vision to the Dark --

And meet the Road -- erect --

And so of larger -- Darkness --

Those Evenings of the Brain --

When not a Moon disclose a sign --

Or Star -- come out -- within --

The Bravest -- grope a little --

And sometimes hit a Tree

Directly in the Forehead --

But as they learn to see --

Either the Darkness alters --

Or something in the sight

Adjusts itself to Midnight --

And Life steps almost straight.

Emily Dickinson





We learned the Whole of Love


We learned the Whole of Love&mdash; The Alphabet&mdash;the Words&mdash; A Chapter&mdash;then the mighty Book&mdash; Then&mdash;Revelation closed&mdash; But in Each Other's eyes

An Ignorance beheld&mdash;

Diviner than the Childhood's&mdash; And each to each, a Child&mdash;

Attempted to expound

What Neither&mdash;understood&mdash; Alas, that Wisdom is so large&mdash; And Truth&mdash;so manifold!

Emily Dickinson





We like march, his shoes are purple,

We like March, his shoes are purple,

He is new and high;

Makes he mud for dog and peddler,

Makes he forest dry;

Knows the adder's tongue his coming,

And begets her spot.

Stands the sun so close and mighty

That our minds are hot.

News is he of all the others;

Bold it were to die

With the blue-birds buccaneering

On his British sky.

Emily Dickinson

We met as Sparks&mdash;Diverging Flints Sent various&mdash;scattered ways&mdash; We parted as the Central Flint

Were cloven with an Adze&mdash;

Subsisting on the Light We bore

Before We felt the Dark&mdash;

A Flint unto this Day&mdash;perhaps&mdash; But for that single Spark.

Emily Dickinson

Include Us&mdash;as they go&mdash; Emily Dickinson

We outgrow love like other things

And put it in the drawer,

Till it an antique fashion shows

Like costumes grandsires wore.

We pray&mdash;to Heaven&mdash; We prate&mdash;of Heaven&mdash; Relate&mdash;when Neighbors die&mdash; At what o'clock to heaven&mdash;they fled&mdash; Who saw them&mdash;Wherefore fly?

Is Heaven a Place&mdash;a Sky&mdash;a Tree?

Location's narrow way is for Ourselves&mdash; Unto the Dead

We see&mdash;Comparatively


We see&mdash;Comparatively&mdash; The Thing so towering high

We could not grasp its segment

Unaided&mdash;Yesterday&mdash; This Morning's finer Verdict&mdash; Makes scarcely worth the toil&mdash; A furrow&mdash;Our Cordillera&mdash; Our Apennine&mdash;a Knoll&mdash; Perhaps 'tis kindly&mdash;done us&mdash; The Anguish&mdash;and the loss&mdash; The wrenching&mdash;for His Firmament The Thing belonged to us&mdash;

To spare these Striding Spirits

Some Morning of Chagrin&mdash;

We should not mind so small a flower


We should not mind so small a flower&mdash; Except it quiet bring

Our little garden that we lost

Back to the Lawn again.

So spicy her Carnations nod&mdash; So drunken, reel her Bees&mdash;

So silver steal a hundred flutes

From out a hundred trees&mdash;

That whoso sees this little flower

By faith may clear behold

The Bobolinks around the throne

And Dandelions gold.

Emily Dickinson





We talked as Girls do


We talked as Girls do&mdash;

Fond, and late&mdash;

We speculated fair, on every subject, but the Grave&mdash; Of ours, none affair&mdash;

We handled Destinies, as cool&mdash; As we&mdash;Disposers&mdash;be&mdash; And God, a Quiet Party

To our Authority&mdash;

But fondest, dwelt upon Ourself

As we eventual&mdash;be&mdash; When Girls to Women, softly raised

We&mdash;occupy&mdash;Degree&mdash; We parted with a contract

To cherish, and to write

But Heaven made both, impossible

Before another night.

Emily Dickinson






We thirst at first&mdash;'tis Nature's Act&mdash; And later&mdash;when we die&mdash; A little Water supplicate&mdash;

We'll pass without the parting


We'll pass without the parting

So to spare

Certificate of Absence&mdash;

Deeming where

I left Her I could find Her

If I tried&mdash;

This way, I keep from missing

Those that died.

Went up a year this evening!


Went up a year this evening!

I recollect it well!

Amid no bells nor bravoes

The bystanders will tell!

Cheerful&mdash;as to the village&mdash; Tranquil&mdash;as to repose&mdash; Chastened&mdash;as to the Chapel

This humble Tourist rose!

Did not talk of returning!

Alluded to no time

When, were the gales propitious&mdash; We might look for him!

Was grateful for the Roses

In life's diverse bouquet&mdash;

Talked softly of new species

To pick another day;

Beguiling thus the wonder

The wondrous nearer drew&mdash;

Hands bustled at the moorings&mdash; The crown respectful grew&mdash;

Ascended from our vision

To Countenances new!

A Difference&mdash;A Daisy&mdash; Is all the rest I knew!

Emily Dickinson

What care the Dead, for Chanticleer


What care the Dead, for Chanticleer&mdash; What care the Dead for Day?

'Tis late your Sunrise vex their face&mdash; And Purple Ribaldry&mdash;of Morning Pour as blank on them

As on the Tier of Wall

The Mason builded, yesterday,

And equally as cool&mdash;

What care the Dead for Summer?

The Solstice had no Sun

Could waste the Snow before their Gate&mdash; And knew One Bird a Tune&mdash;

Could thrill their Mortised Ear

Of all the Birds that be&mdash;

This One&mdash;beloved of Mankind

Henceforward cherished be&mdash;

What care the Dead for Winter?

Themselves as easy freeze&mdash;

June Noon&mdash;as January Night&mdash; As soon the South&mdash;her Breeze Of Sycamore&mdash;or Cinnamon&mdash; Deposit in a Stone

And put a Stone to keep it Warm&mdash; Give Spices&mdash;unto Men&mdash; Emily Dickinson





What did They do since I saw Them?


What did They do since I saw Them?

Were They industrious?

So many questions to put Them

Have I the eagerness

That could I snatch Their Faces

That could Their lips reply

Not till the last was answered

Should They start for the Sky.

Not if Their Party were waiting,

Not if to talk with Me

Were to Them now, Homesickness

After Eternity.

Not if the Just suspect me

And offer a Reward

Would I restore my Booty

To that Bold Person, God&mdash;

What Inn is this


What Inn is this

Where for the night

Peculiar Traveller comes?

Who is the Landlord?

Where the maids?

Behold, what curious rooms!

No ruddy fires on the hearth&mdash; No brimming Tankards flow&mdash;

Necromancer! Landlord!

Who are these below?

What is—


What is—"Paradise"—

Who live there—

Are they "Farmers"—

Do they "hoe"—

Do they know that this is "Amherst"—

And that I—am coming—too—

Do they wear "new shoes"—in "Eden"—

Is it always pleasant—there—

Won't they scold us—when we're homesick—

Or tell God—how cross we are—

You are sure there's such a person

As "a Father"—in the sky—

So if I get lost—there—ever—

Or do what the Nurse calls "die"—

I shan't walk the "Jasper"—barefoot—

Ransomed folks—won't laugh at me—

Maybe—"Eden" a'n't so lonesome As New England used to be!

What shall I do when the Summer troubles&mdash; What, when the Rose is ripe&mdash; What when the Eggs fly off in Music

From the Maple Keep?

What shall I do when the Skies a'chirrup Drop a Tune on me&mdash;

When the Bee hangs all Noon in the Buttercup What will become of me?

Oh, when the Squirrel fills His Pockets And the Berries stare

How can I bear their jocund Faces

Thou from Here, so far?

All day and night with bark and start&mdash; And yet, it will not go&mdash;

Would you untie it, were you me&mdash; Would it stop whining&mdash;if to Thee&mdash; I sent it&mdash;even now?

It should not tease you&mdash;

What would I give to see his face?

I'd give&mdash;I'd give my life&mdash;of course&mdash; But that is not enough!

Stop just a minute&mdash;let me think!

I'd give my biggest Bobolink!

Roses a day from Zanzibar&mdash;

That are sown beneath,

To bloom so, bye and bye&mdash;

When I con the people

Lain so low,

To be received as high&mdash;

When I believe the garden

Mortal shall not see&mdash;

Pick by faith its blossom

And avoid its Bee,

I can spare this summer, unreluctantly.

Emily Dickinson





When I have seen the Sun emerge


When I have seen the Sun emerge

From His amazing House&mdash;

And leave a Day at every Door

A Deed, in every place&mdash;

Without the incident of Fame

Or accident of Noise&mdash;

The Earth has seemed to me a Drum,

Pursued of little Boys

Emily Dickinson





When I hoped, I recollect


When I hoped, I recollect

Just the place I stood&mdash;

At a Window facing West&mdash;

Roughest Air&mdash;was good&mdash; Not a Sleet could bite me&mdash;

Not a frost could cool&mdash;

Hope it was that kept me warm&mdash; Not Merino shawl&mdash;

When I feared&mdash;I recollect

Just the Day it was&mdash;

Worlds were lying out to Sun&mdash; Yet how Nature froze&mdash;

Icicles upon my soul

Prickled Blue and Cool&mdash;

Bird went praising everywhere&mdash; Only Me&mdash;was still&mdash; And the Day that I despaired&mdash; This&mdash;if I forget

Nature will&mdash;that it be Night After Sun has set&mdash;

Darkness intersect her face&mdash; And put out her eye&mdash;

Nature hesitate&mdash;before

Memory and I&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





When I was small, a Woman died


When I was small, a Woman died&mdash; Today&mdash;her Only Boy

Went up from the Potomac&mdash;

His face all Victory

To look at her&mdash;How slowly

The Seasons must have turned

Till Bullets clipt an Angle

And He passed quickly round&mdash; If pride shall be in Paradise&mdash; Ourself cannot decide&mdash;

Of their imperial Conduct&mdash;

No person testified&mdash;

But, proud in Apparition&mdash;

That Woman and her Boy

Pass back and forth, before my Brain

As even in the sky&mdash;

I'm confident that Bravoes&mdash;

Perpetual break abroad

For Braveries, remote as this

In Scarlet Maryland&mdash;

Emily Dickinson






When Katie walks, this simple pair accompany her side, When Katie runs unwearied they follow on the road, When Katie kneels, their loving hands still clasp her pious knee&mdash; Ah! Katie! Smile at Fortune, with two so knit to thee!

Emily Dickinson





When Night is almost done


When Night is almost done&mdash;

And Sunrise grows so near

That we can touch the Spaces&mdash; It's time to smooth the Hair&mdash; And get the Dimples ready&mdash;

And wonder we could care

For that old&mdash;faded Midnight&mdash; That frightened&mdash;but an Hour&mdash; Emily Dickinson





When One has given up One's life


When One has given up One's life

The parting with the rest

Feels easy, as when Day lets go

Entirely the West

The Peaks, that lingered last

Remain in Her regret

As scarcely as the Iodine

Upon the Cataract.

Emily Dickinson





When Roses cease to bloom, Sir


When Roses cease to bloom, Sir,

And Violets are done&mdash;

When Bumblebees in solemn flight

Have passed beyond the Sun&mdash;

The hand that paused to gather

Upon this Summer's day

Will idle lie&mdash;in Auburn&mdash; Then take my flowers&mdash;pray!

Emily Dickinson





When the Astronomer stops seeking


When the Astronomer stops seeking

For his Pleiad's Face&mdash;

When the lone British Lady

Forsakes the Arctic Race

When to his Covenant Needle

The Sailor doubting turns&mdash;

It will be amply early

To ask what treason means.

Emily Dickinson





When we stand on the tops of Things


When we stand on the tops of Things&mdash; And like the Trees, look down&mdash; The smoke all cleared away from it&mdash; And Mirrors on the scene&mdash;

Just laying light&mdash;no soul will wink Except it have the flaw&mdash;

The Sound ones, like the Hills&mdash;shall stand&mdash; No Lighting, scares away&mdash;

The Perfect, nowhere be afraid&mdash; They bear their dauntless Heads,

Where others, dare not go at Noon,

Protected by their deeds&mdash;

The Stars dare shine occasionally

Upon a spotted World&mdash;

And Suns, go surer, for their Proof,

As if an Axle, held&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Where bells no more affright the morn


Where bells no more affright the morn&mdash; Where scrabble never comes&mdash;

Where very nimble Gentlemen

Are forced to keep their rooms&mdash; Where tired Children placid sleep

Thro' Centuries of noon

This place is Bliss&mdash;this town is Heaven&mdash; Please, Pater, pretty soon!

"Oh could we climb where Moses stood, And view the Landscape o'er"

Not Father's bells&mdash;nor Factories, Could scare us any more!

Emily Dickinson





Where I have lost, I softer tread


Where I have lost, I softer tread&mdash; I sow sweet flower from garden bed&mdash; I pause above that vanished head

And mourn.

Whom I have lost, I pious guard

From accent harsh, or ruthless word&mdash; Feeling as if their pillow heard,

Though stone!

When I have lost, you'll know by this&mdash; A Bonnet black&mdash;A dusk surplice&mdash; A little tremor in my voice

Like this!

Why, I have lost, the people know

Who dressed in flocks of purest snow

Went home a century ago

Next Bliss!

Emily Dickinson

Fantastic Sailors&mdash;mingle&mdash; And then&mdash;the Wharf is still!

Whether my bark went down at sea


Whether my bark went down at sea&mdash; Whether she met with gales&mdash;

Whether to isles enchanted

She bent her docile sails&mdash;

By what mystic mooring

She is held today&mdash;

This is the errand of the eye

Out upon the Bay.

Emily Dickinson





While Asters—


While Asters—

On the Hill—

Their Everlasting fashions—set—

And Covenant Gentians—Frill!

While it is alive


While it is alive

Until Death touches it

While it and I lap one Air

Dwell in one Blood

Under one Sacrament

Show me Division can split or pare&mdash; Love is like Life&mdash;merely longer Love is like Death, during the Grave

Love is the Fellow of the Resurrection Scooping up the Dust and chanting "Live"!

Emily Dickinson





Who Court obtain within Himself


Who Court obtain within Himself

Sees every Man a King&mdash;

And Poverty of Monarchy

Is an interior thing&mdash;

No Man depose

Whom Fate Ordain&mdash;

And Who can add a Crown

To Him who doth continual

Conspire against His Own

Emily Dickinson





Who Giants know, with lesser Men


Who Giants know, with lesser Men

Are incomplete, and shy&mdash;

For Greatness, that is ill at ease

In minor Company&mdash;

A Smaller, could not be perturbed&mdash; The Summer Gnat displays&mdash;

Unconscious that his single Fleet

Do not comprise the skies&mdash;

Emily Dickinson





Who never lost, are unprepared


Who never lost, are unprepared

A Coronet to find!

Who never thirsted

Flagons, and Cooling Tamarind!

Who never climbed the weary league&mdash; Can such a foot explore

The purple territories

On Pizarro's shore?

How many Legions overcome&mdash;

The Emperor will say?

How many Colors taken

On Revolution Day?

How many Bullets bearest?

Hast Thou the Royal scar?

Angels! Write "Promoted"

On this Soldier's brow!

Emily Dickinson





Who occupies this House?


Who occupies this House?

A Stranger I must judge

Since No one know His Circumstance&mdash;

'Tis well the name and age

Are writ upon the Door

Or I should fear to pause

Where not so much as Honest Dog

Approach encourages.

It seems a curious Town&mdash;

Some Houses very old,

Some&mdash;newly raised this Afternoon, Were I compelled to build

It should not be among

Inhabitants so still

But where the Birds assemble

And Boys were possible.

Before Myself was born

'Twas settled, so they say,

A Territory for the Ghosts&mdash;

And Squirrels, formerly.

Until a Pioneer, as

Settlers often do

Liking the quiet of the Place

Attracted more unto&mdash;

And from a Settlement

A Capital has grown

Distinguished for the gravity

Of every Citizen.

The Owner of this House

A Stranger He must be&mdash;

Eternity's Acquaintances

Are mostly so&mdash;to me.

Emily Dickinson

Whole Gulfs—of Red, and Fleets—of Red—

Emily Dickinson





Whose are the little beds, I asked


Whose are the little beds, I asked

Which in the valleys lie?

Some shook their heads, and others smiled&mdash; And no one made reply.

Perhaps they did not hear, I said,

I will inquire again&mdash;

Whose are the beds&mdash;the tiny beds So thick upon the plain?

'Tis Daisy, in the shortest&mdash; A little further on&mdash;

Nearest the door&mdash;to wake the Ist&mdash; Little Leontoden.

'Tis Iris, Sir, and Aster&mdash;

Anemone, and Bell&mdash;

Bartsia, in the blanket red&mdash; And chubby Daffodil.

Meanwhile, at many cradles

Her busy foot she plied&mdash;

Humming the quaintest lullaby

That ever rocked a child.

Hush! Epigea wakens!

The Crocus stirs her lids&mdash;

Rhodora's cheek is crimson,

She's dreaming of the woods!

Then turning from them reverent&mdash; Their bedtime 'tis, she said&mdash; The Bumble bees will wake them

When April woods are red.

Emily Dickinson





Whose cheek is this?


Whose cheek is this?

What rosy face

Has lost a blush today?

I found her&mdash;"pleiad"&mdash;in the woods And bore her safe away.

Robins, in the tradition

Did cover such with leaves,

But which the cheek&mdash;

And which the pall

My scrutiny deceives.

Emily Dickinson





Why do I love You, Sir?

"Why do I love" You, Sir?

Because—

The Wind does not require the Grass

To answer—Wherefore when He pass

She cannot keep Her place.

Because He knows—and

Do not You—

And We know not—

Enough for Us

The Wisdom it be so—

The Lightning—never asked an Eye

Wherefore it shut—when He was by—

Because He knows it cannot speak—

And reasons not contained—

—Of Talk—

There be—preferred by Daintier Folk—

The Sunrise—Sire—compelleth Me—

Because He's Sunrise—and I see—

Therefore—Then—

I love Thee—

Emily Dickinson






Why make it doubt&mdash;it hurts it so&mdash; So sick&mdash;to guess&mdash;

Why&mdash;do they shut Me out of Heaven?


Why&mdash;do they shut Me out of Heaven?

Did I sing&mdash;too loud?

But&mdash;I can say a little "Minor"

Timid as a Bird!

Wouldn't the Angels try me&mdash;

Just&mdash;once&mdash;more&mdash; Just&mdash;see&mdash;if I troubled them&mdash; But don't&mdash;shut the door!

Oh, if I&mdash;were the Gentleman

Wild Nights - Wild Nights!

Wild nights - wild nights!

Were I with thee,

Wild nights should be

Our luxury.

Futile the winds

To a heart in port

Done with the compass,

Done with the chart.

Rowing in Eden -

Ah, the sea!

Might I but moor tonight

In thee.

Will there really be a


Will there really be a "Morning"?

Is there such a thing as "Day"?

Could I see it from the mountains

If I were as tall as they?

Has it feet like Water lilies?

Has it feathers like a Bird?

Is it brought from famous countries

Of which I have never heard?

Oh some Scholar! Oh some Sailor!

Oh some Wise Men from the skies!

Please to tell a little Pilgrim

Where the place called "Morning" lies!

Within my Garden, rides a Bird


Within my Garden, rides a Bird

Upon a single Wheel&mdash;

Whose spokes a dizzy Music make

As 'twere a travelling Mill&mdash; He never stops, but slackens

Above the Ripest Rose&mdash;

Partakes without alighting

And praises as he goes,

Till every spice is tasted&mdash;

And then his Fairy Gig

Reels in remoter atmospheres&mdash; And I rejoin my Dog,

And He and I, perplex us

If positive, 'twere we&mdash;

Or bore the Garden in the Brain

This Curiosity&mdash;

But He, the best Logician,

Refers my clumsy eye&mdash;

To just vibrating Blossoms!

An Exquisite Reply!

Emily Dickinson





Within my reach!


Within my reach!

I could have touched!

I might have chanced that way!

Soft sauntered thro' the village&mdash; Sauntered as soft away!

So unsuspected Violets

Within the meadows go&mdash;

Too late for striving fingers

That passed, an hour ago!

Emily Dickinson

Wolfe demanded during dying

A worm his utmost goal.

Would you like summer? Taste of ours


Would you like summer? Taste of ours.

Spices? Buy here!

Ill! We have berries, for the parching!

Weary! Furloughs of down!

Perplexed! Estates of violet trouble ne'er looked on!

Captive! We bring reprieve of roses!

Fainting! Flasks of air!

Even for Death, a fairy medicine.

But, which is it, sir?

You cannot put a Fire out


You cannot put a Fire out&mdash;

A Thing that can ignite

Can go, itself, without a Fan&mdash; Upon the slowest Night&mdash;

You cannot fold a Flood&mdash;

With Fingers—where the Toes should be—

Would more affront the Sand—

Than this Quaint Creature's Boot—

Adjusted by a Stern—

Without a Button—I could vouch—

Unto a Velvet Limb—

You'll know Her—by Her Vest—

Tight fitting—Orange—Brown—

Inside a Jacket duller—

She wore when she was born—

Her Cap is small—and snug—

Constructed for the Winds—

She'd pass for Barehead—short way off—

But as She Closer stands—

So finer 'tis than Wool—

You cannot feel the Seam—

Nor is it Clasped unto of Band—

Nor held upon—of Brim—

You'll know Her—by Her Voice—

At first—a doubtful Tone—

A sweet endeavor—but as March

To April—hurries on—

She squanders on your Ear

Such Arguments of Pearl—

You beg the Robin in your Brain

To keep the other—still—

Emily Dickinson






You'll know it&mdash;as you know 'tis Noon&mdash; By Glory&mdash;

As you do the Sun&mdash;

By Glory&mdash;

As you will in Heaven&mdash;

Know God the Father&mdash;and the Son.

By intuition, Mightiest Things

Assert themselves&mdash;and not by terms&mdash;

"I'm Midnight"&mdash;need the Midnight say&mdash;

"I'm Sunrise"&mdash;Need the Majesty?

Omnipotence&mdash;had not a Tongue&mdash; His listp&mdash;is Lightning&mdash;and the Sun&mdash; His Conversation&mdash;with the Sea&mdash;

"How shall you know"?

Consult your Eye!

Emily Dickinson





You'll know it—as you know 'tis Noon


You'll know it—as you know 'tis Noon—

By Glory—

As you will in Heaven—

Know God the Father—and the Son.

By intuition, Mightiest Things

Assert themselves—and not by terms—

"I'm Midnight"—need the Midnight say—

"I'm Sunrise"—Need the Majesty?

Omnipotence—had not a Tongue—

His listp—is Lightning—and the Sun—

His Conversation—with the Sea—

"How shall you know"?

Consult your Eye!

Emily Dickinson






Your Riches&mdash;taught me&mdash;Poverty.

Myself&mdash;a Millionaire

In little Wealths, as Girls could boast Till broad as Buenos Ayre&mdash;

You drifted your Dominions&mdash;

A Different Peru&mdash;

And I esteemed All Poverty

For Life's Estate with you&mdash;

Of Mines, I little know&mdash;myself&mdash; But just the names, of Gems&mdash; The Colors of the Commonest&mdash; And scarce of Diadems&mdash;

So much, that did I meet the Queen&mdash; Her Glory I should know&mdash;

But this, must be a different Wealth&mdash; To miss it&mdash;beggars so&mdash; I'm sure 'tis India&mdash;all Day&mdash; To those who look on You&mdash;

Without a stint&mdash;without a blame, Might I&mdash;but be the Jew&mdash; I'm sure it is Golconda&mdash;

Beyond my power to deem&mdash;

To have a smile for Mine&mdash;each Day, How better, than a Gem!

At least, it solaces to know

That there exists&mdash;a Gold&mdash; Altho' I prove it, just in time

Its distance&mdash;to behold&mdash; Its far&mdash;far Treasure to surmise&mdash; And estimate the Pearl&mdash;

That slipped my simple fingers through&mdash; While just a Girl at School.

You're right—


You're right—"the way is narrow"—

And "difficult the Gate"—

And "few there be"—Correct again—

That "enter in—thereat"—

'Tis Costly—So are purples!

'Tis just the price of Breath—

With but the "Discount" of the Grave—

Termed by the Brokers—"Death"!

And after that—there's Heaven—

The Good Man's—"Dividend"—

And Bad Men—"go to Jail"—

I guess—

You've seen Balloons set&mdash;Haven't You?

He forgot—and I—remembered

He fought like those Who've nought to lose

He found my Being—set it up

He fumbles at your Soul

He fumbles at your spirit

He gave away his Life

He outstripped Time with but a Bout

He parts Himself—like Leaves

He put the Belt around my life

He strained my faith

He told a homely tale

He touched me, so I live to know

He was weak, and I was strong—then

He who in Himself believes

Heart! We will forget him!

Heart, not so heavy as mine

Heart, We Will Forget Him

Heaven

Heaven is so far of the Mind

Heaven is what I cannot reach!

Her breast is fit for pearls

Her final Summer was it

Her final summer was it,

��H

Her Grace is all she has—

Her smile was shaped like other smiles

Her Sweet turn to leave the Homestead

Her sweet Weight on my Heart a Night

Her—"last Poems"

Herein a Blossom lies

His Bill an Auger is

His Feet are shod with Gauze

Home

Hope is the thing with feathers

��H

��H

How far is it to Heaven?

How fortunate the Grave

How happy I was if I could forget

How happy is the little Stone

How many Flowers fail in Wood

How many times these low feet staggered

How noteless Men, and Pleiads, stand

How sick—to wait—in any place—but thine

��H

How the old Mountains drip with Sunset

How the Waters closed above Him

How well I knew Her not

I am alive—I guess

��I

I am ashamed—I hide

��I

I asked no other thing

I breathed enough to learn the trick,

I breathed enough to take the Trick

I bring an unaccustomed wine

I Came to buy a smile—today

��I

I can wade Grief

I cannot be ashamed

I cannot buy it—'tis not sold

��I

I cannot dance upon my Toes

I cannot live with You


I cannot live with you,

I can't tell you—but you feel it

��I

I cautious, scanned my little life

I could bring You Jewels—had I a mind to

��I

I could die—to know

��I

I could not drink it, Sweet

I could not prove the Years had feet

I could suffice for Him, I knew

I cried at Pity—not at Pain

��I

I cross till I am weary

I Died For Beauty

I died for beauty but was scarce

I died for Beauty—but was scarce

��I

I dreaded that first Robin, so

I dwell in Possibility

I envy Seas, whereon He rides

I fear a Man of frugal Speech

I felt a cleaving in my mind

I felt a funeral in my brain,

I felt a Funeral, in my Brain


I felt my life with both my hands

I found the phrase to every thought

I found the words to every thought

I gained it so

I gave myself to Him

I got so I could take his name

I had a guinea golden

I had been hungry all the years-

I had been hungry, all the Years

I had no Cause to be awake

I had no time to Hate

I had no time to hate, because

I had not minded—Walls

��I

I had some things that I called mine

I had the Glory—that will do

��I

I have a Bird in spring

I have a King, who does not speak

I have never seen

I have never seen "Volcanoes"

I haven't told my garden yet

I heard a Fly buzz -- when I died --


I heard a fly buzz when I died;

I heard a Fly buzz—when I died

I held a Jewel in my fingers

I hide myself within my flower

I keep my pledge

I know a place where summer strives

I know lives, I could miss

I know some lonely Houses off the Road

I know that He exists

I know where Wells grow—Droughtless Wells

��I

I learned—at least—what Home could be

��I

I like a look of Agony

I like to see it lap the Miles

I like to see it lap the miles,

I live with Him—I see His face

��I

I lived on Dread

I lived on dread; to those who know

I lost a World - the other day!

I made slow Riches but my Gain

I make His Crescent fill or lack

I many times thought Peace had come

I meant to find Her when I came

I meant to have but modest needs

I measure every grief I meet


I ment to find her when I came;

I met a King this afternoon!

I never felt at Home—Below

��I

I never hear the word

I never hear the word "escape"

I never hear the word 'escape'

I never lost as much but twice

I Never Saw a Moor

I never saw a moor,

I never told the buried gold

I often passed the village

I pay—in Satin Cash

��I

I play at Riches—to appease

��I

I prayed, at first, a little Girl

I read my sentence—steadily

��I

I reason, Earth is short

I reckon—when I count it all

��I

I robbed the Woods

I rose—because He sank

��I

I saw no Way—The Heavens were stitched

��I

I see thee better—in the Dark

��I

I send Two Sunsets

I shall keep singing!

I shall know why—when Time is over

��I

I should have been too glad, I see

I should not dare to leave my friend

I showed her Heights she never saw

I sing to use the Waiting

I sometimes drop it, for a Quick

I started Early - Took my Dog

I started Early—Took my Dog

I stepped from plank to plank

I stole them from a Bee

I taste a liquor never brewed

I tend my flowers for thee

I think I was enchanted

I think just how my shape will rise

I think the Hemlock likes to stand

I think the longest Hour of all

I think to Live—may be a Bliss

��I

I tie my Hat—I crease my Shawl

��I

I took my Power in my Hand

I tried to think a lonelier Thing

��I

I was the slightest in the House

I watched the Moon around the House


I went to Heaven

I went to heaven,--

I went to thank Her

I would distil a cup

I would not paint—a picture

��I

I Years had been from Home

I years had been from home,

��I

Ideals are the Fairly Oil

If any sink, assure that this, now standing

If anybody's friend be dead

If Blame be my side—forfeit Me

��I

If He dissolve—then—there is nothing

��I

If He were living—dare I ask

��I

If I Can Stop One Heart from Breaking

If I can stop one heart from breaking,

If I could bribe them by a Rose

If I may have it, when it's dead

If I should cease to bring a Rose

If I should die

If I shouldn't be alive

If I'm lost—now

��I

If it had no pencil

If pain for peace prepares

If recollecting were forgetting

If she had been the Mistletoe

If the foolish, call them

If the foolish, call them "flowers"

If this is

If this is "fading"

If those I loved were lost

If What we could—were what we would

��I

If you were coming in the Fall

If you were coming in the fall,

If your Nerve, deny you

I'll clutch—and clutch

��I

I'll send the feather from my Hat!

I'll tell you how the Sun rose

I'll tell you how the sun rose, --

I'm

I'm "wife"—I've finished that

I'm ceded—I've stopped being Theirs

��I

I'm nobody! Who are you?


I'm saying every day

I'm sorry for the Dead—Today

��I

I'm the little

I'm the little "Heart's Ease"

Impossibility, like Wine

In Ebon Box, when years have flown

In falling Timbers buried

In lands I never saw—they say

��I

In rags mysterious as these

In Winter in my Room

Inconceivably solemn!

Is Bliss then, such Abyss

Is it dead—Find it

��I

Is it true, dear Sue?

It always felt to me—a wrong

��I

It bloomed and dropt, a Single Noon

It can't be

It can't be "Summer"!

It ceased to hurt me, though so slow

It did not surprise me

It don't sound so terrible—quite—as it did

��I

It Dropped So Low -- In My Regard --

It dropped so low in my regard

It dropped so low—in my Regard

It feels a shame to be Alive

It is a lonesome Glee

It is an honorable Thought

It is an honorable thought,

It is easy to work when the soul is at play

It knew no lapse, nor Diminuation

It knew no Medicine

It makes no difference abroad

It might be lonelier

It sifts from Leaden Sieves

It struck me every day

It struck me—every Day

��I

It tossed—and tossed

��I

It troubled me as once I was

It was a Grave, yet bore no Stone

It was given to me by the Gods

It was not Death, for I stood up

It was not death, for I stood up,

It was too late for Man

It will be Summer—eventually

��I

It would have starved a Gnat

It would never be Common—more—I said

��I

It's all I have to bring today

It's All I have to bring to-day,

It's coming—the postponeless Creature

��I

It's easy to invent a Life

It's like the Light

It's like the light, --

It's such a little thing to weep

It's thoughts—and just One Heart

��I

I've heard an Organ talk, sometimes

I've known a Heaven, like a Tent

I've none to tell me to but Thee

I've nothing else—to bring, You know

��I

I've seen a Dying Eye

Jesus! thy Crucifix

Joy to have merited the Pain

Just as He spoke it from his Hands

Just lost, when I was saved!

Just so—Jesus—raps

��J

Kill your Balm—and its Odors bless you

��K

Knows how to forget!

Least Bee that brew

Least Rivers—docile to some sea

��L

Let Us play Yesterday

Life—is what we make of it

Life, and Death, and Giants

��L

Light is sufficient to itself

Like eyes that looked on Wastes

Like Flowers, that heard the news of Dews

Like her the Saints retire

Like Mighty Foot Lights—burned the Red

��L

Like Some Old fashioned Miracle

Like trains of cars on tracks of plush

Love reckons by itself—alone

��L

Love—is anterior to Life

Love—is that later Thing than Death

Love—thou art high

��L

��L

��L

Low at my problem bending

Make me a picture of the sun

Mama never forgets her birds

Many a phrase has the English language

Many cross the Rhine

Me from Myself—to banish

��M

Me prove it now—Whoever doubt

��M

Me! Come! My dazzled face

Me—come! My dazzled face

Me, change! Me, alter!

Midsummer, was it, when They died

Mine—by the Right of the White Election!

��M

More Life—went out—when He went

��M

Morning—is the place for Dew

��M

��M

Morns like these—we parted

��M

Most she touched me by her muteness

Much Madness is divinest Sense

Musicians wrestle everywhere

Must be a Woe

Mute thy Coronation

My best Acquaintances are those

My Eye is fuller than my vase

My Faith is larger than the Hills

My first well Day—since many ill

��M

My friend attacks my friend!

My friend must be a Bird

My Garden—like the Beach

��M

My life closed twice

My life closed twice before its close

My life closed twice before its close;

My life had stood

My Life had stood—a Loaded Gun

My nosegays are for Captives

My nosegays are for captives;

My period had come for Prayer

My Portion is Defeat—today

��M

My Reward for Being, was This

My River runs to thee

My Soul—accused me—And I quailed

��M

My wheel is in the dark

My Worthiness is all my Doubt

Myself was formed—a Carpenter

��M

Nature and God—I neither knew

��N

��N

Nature rarer uses yellow

Nature the gentlest mother is

Nature—sometimes sears a Sapling

Nature—the Gentlest Mother is

Nature, the gentlest mother,

��N

��N

Never for Society

New feet within my garden go

No Bobolink—reverse His Singing

��N

No Crowd that has occurred

No Man can compass a Despair

No matter—now—Sweet

��N

No Notice gave She, but a Change

No Other can reduce

No Prisoner be

No Rack can torture me

No Romance sold unto

Nobody knows this little Rose

None can experience sting

Noon—is the Hinge of Day

��N

Not

Not "Revelation"—'tis—that waits

Not all die early, dying young

Not in this world to see his face

Not probable—The barest Chance

��N

Not that We did, shall be the test

Of all the souls that stand create

Of all the Sounds despatched abroad

Of Being is a Bird

Of Bronze—and Blaze

��O

Of Brussels—it was not

��O

Of Consciousness, her awful Mate

Of Course—I prayed

��O

Of nearness to her sundered Things

Of Silken Speech and Specious Shoe

Of Tolling Bell I ask the cause?

Of Tribulation, these are They

On a Columnar Self

On such a night, or such a night

On that dear Frame the Years had worn

On this long storm the Rainbow rose

On this wondrous sea

Once more, my now bewildered Dove

One and One—are One

��O

One Anguish—in a Crowd

��O

One Blessing had I than the rest

One Crucifixion is recorded—only

��O

One Day is there of the Series

One dignity delays for all

One Life of so much Consequence!

One need not be a chamber to be haunted,

One need not be a Chamber—to be Haunted

��O

One Sister have I in our house

One Year ago—jots what?

��O

Only a Shrine, but Mine

Only God—detect the Sorrow

��O

Our journey had advanced

Our journey had advanced;

Our little Kinsmen—after Rain

��O

Our Lives Are Swiss

��O

Our lives are Swiss—

Our share of night to bear

Ourselves were wed one summer—dear

��O

Out of sight? What of that?

Over and over, like a Tune

Over the fence

Pain

Pain Has An Element

Pain has an element of blank;

Pain—expands the Time

Pain—has an Element of Blank

��P

Pain--has an Element of Blank--

Papa above!

Partake as doth the Bee

Patience—has a quiet Outer

��P

Peace is a fiction of our Faith

Perhaps I Asked Too Large

Perhaps you think me stooping

Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower

Pigmy seraphs—gone astray

��P

Poor little Heart!

Portraits are to daily faces

Prayer is the little implement

Precious to Me—She still shall be

��P

Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn

Presentiment—is that long Shadow—on the Lawn

Promise This—When You be Dying

��P

Publication

Publication—is the Auction

��P

Purple—is fashionable twice

��P

Put up my lute!

Read—Sweet—how others—strove

Rehearsal to Ourselves

Remorse

Remorse—is Memory—awake

Removed from Accident of Loss

Renunciation

Renunciation—is a piercing Virtue

Rest at Night

Reverse cannot befall

Ribbons of the Year

Robbed by Death—but that was easy

��R

Safe in Their Alabaster Chambers

Safe in their alabaster chambers,

Savior! I've no one else to tell

Severer Service of myself

Sexton! My Master's sleeping here

She bore it till the simple veins

She dealt her pretty words like Blades

She died at play

She died—this was the way she died

��S

She dwelleth in the Ground

She hideth Her the last

She lay as if at play

She rose to His Requirement

She rose to His Requirement - dropt

She rose to his requirement, dropped

She sights a Bird—she chuckles

��S

She slept beneath a tree

She sped as Petals of a Rose

She staked her Feathers—Gained an Arc

��S

She sweeps with many-colored Brooms

She sweeps with many-colored brooms,

She went as quiet as the Dew

Shells from the Coast mistaking

She's happy, with a new Content

Should you but fail at—Sea

��S

Sic transit gloria mundi

Size circumscribes—it has no room

��S

Sleep is supposed to be

Smiling back from Coronation

Snow beneath whose chilly softness

Snow flakes

So bashful when I spied her!

So bashful when I spied her,

So from the mould

So glad we are—a Stranger'd deem

��S

So has a Daisy vanished

So much Summer

So proud she was to die

So set its Sun in Thee

So the Eyes accost—and sunder

��S

So well that I can live without

Soil of Flint, if steady tilled

Some Keep the Sabbath Going to Church

Some Rainbow—coming from the Fair!

��S

Some such Butterfly be seen

Some things that fly there be

Some—Work for Immortality

Some, too fragile for winter winds

��S

Soto! Explore thyself!

Soul, Wilt thou toss again?

South Winds jostle them

Sown in dishonor

��S

Split the Lark

Split the Lark—and you'll find the Music

��S

Spring is the Period

Strong Draughts of Their Refreshing Minds

Struck, was I, not yet by Lightning

Success is Counted Sweetest

Such is the Force of Happiness

Summer for thee, grant I may be

Summer Shower

Sunset at Night—is natural

��S

Superfluous were the Sun

Surgeons must be very careful

Suspense—is Hostiler than Death

��S

Sweet Mountains—Ye tell Me no lie

��S

Sweet—safe—Houses

Sweet—You forgot—but I remembered

Sweet, to have had them lost

��S

��S

T was just this time last year I died.

'T was just this time last year I died.

Take your Heaven further on

Taking up the fair Ideal

Talk with prudence to a Beggar

Teach Him—When He makes the names

��T

Tell All The Truth

Tell all the Truth but tell it slant

That after Horror—that 'twas us

��T

That Distance was between Us

That first Day, when you praised Me, Sweet

That I did always love

That is solemn we have ended

The Admirations—and Contempts—of time

��T

The Angle of a Landscape

The Battle fought between the Soul

The Bee is not afraid of me

The Beggar Lad—dies early

��T

The Bible is an antique Volume

The Bird must sing to earn the Crumb

The Birds begun at Four o'clock

The Birds reported from the South

The Black Berry—wears a Thorn in his side

��T

The Body grows without

The Brain—is wider than the Sky

The Brain, within its Groove

The braind within its groove

��T

The bustle in a house

The Chemical conviction

The Child's faith is new

The Color of a Queen, is this

The Color of the Grave is Green

The Court is far away

The cricket sang,

The Daisy follows soft the Sun

The Day Came Slow

The Day came slow—till Five o'clock

The day came slow, till five o' clock

The Day that I was crowned

The Day undressed—Herself

The Definition of Beauty is

The difference between Despair

The Doomed—regard the Sunrise

��T

The Drop, that wrestles in the Sea

The Dust behind I strove to join

The dying need but little, dear,--

The face I carry with me—last

��T

The feet of people walking home

The Fingers of the Light

The first Day that I was a Life

The first Day's Night had come

The Flower must not blame the Bee

The Future—never spoke

��T

The Gentian weaves her fringes

The good Will of a Flower

The Grace—Myself—might not obtain

��T

The Grass so little has to do

The Guest is gold and crimson

The hallowing of Pain

The heart asks pleasure first

The Heart asks Pleasure—first

The Heart has narrow Banks

The Heaven vests for Each

The Himmaleh was known to stoop

The Hollows round His eager Eyes

The Judge is like the Owl

The Juggler's Hat her Country is

The Lady feeds Her little Bird

The Lamp burns sure—within

��T

The last Night that She lived

The Leaves like Women interchange

The Lightning playeth—all the while

��T

The Loneliness One dare not sound

The lonesome for they know not What

The Love a Life can show Below

The Luxury to apprehend

The Malay—took the Pearl

��T

The Manner of its Death

The Martyr Poets—did not tell

��T

The Missing All—prevented Me

��T

The Months have ends—the Years—a knot

��T

The Moon is distant from the Sea

The Moon was but a Chin of Gold

The Morning after Woe

The morns are meeker than they were

The Mountain sat upon the Plain

The Mountains—grow unnoticed

��T

The Murmur of a Bee

The Mystery of Pain

The name—of it—is "Autumn"

��T

The nearest Dream recedes—unrealized

The nearest dream recedes, unrealized

The nearest dream recedes, unrealized.

��T

The Night was wide, and furnished scant

The One who could repeat the Summer day

The only ghost I ever saw

The Only News I know

The Outer—from the Inner

��T

The pedigree of honey

The Poets light but Lamps

The power to be true to You

The Province of the Saved

The Railway Train

The rainbow never tells me

The Red—Blaze—is the Morning

��T

The Robin for the Crumb

The Robin is the One

The Robin's my Criterion for Tune

The Rose did caper on her cheek

The Service without Hope

The show is not the show,

The Skies can't keep their secret!

The sky is low, the clouds are mean,

The Soul has Bandaged moments

The Soul Selects Her Own Society

The Soul that hath a Guest

The Soul unto itself


The Soul's distinct connection

The Soul's Superior instants

The Spider holds a Silver Ball

The Spirit is the Conscious Ear

The Sun and Moon must make their haste

The Sun is gay or stark

The Sun kept setting—setting—still

��T

The Sun kept stooping—stooping

��T

The Sun—just touched the Morning

��T

The Sunrise runs for Both

The Sunset stopped on Cottages

The sweetest Heresy received

The Test of Love—is Death

��T

The thought beneath so slight a film

The Tint I cannot take—is best

The Trees like Tassels—hit—and swung

The Truth—is stirless

The Veins of other Flowers

The Way I read a Letter's—this

��T

The White Heat

The Whole of it came not at once

The Wind begun to knead the Grass

The wind begun to rock the grass

The Wind didn't come from the Orchard—today

��T

The wind trapped like a tired man,

The Wind—tapped like a tired Man

The Winters are so short

The Woodpecker

The World—feels Dusty

The World—stands—solemner—to me

��T

��T

The Zeroes—taught us—Phosphorous

��T

Their Height in Heaven comforts not

There are two Ripenings—one—of sight

��T

There came a Day at Summer's full

There came a Wind like a Bugle

There is a finished feeling

There is a flower that Bees prefer

There is a June when Corn is cut

There is a Languor of the Life

There is a morn by men unseen

There is a pain—so utter

��T

There is a Shame of Nobleness

There is a word

There is an arid Pleasure

There is another sky

There is no frigate like a book

There's a certain Slant of light


There's a certain slant of light,

There's been a death in the opposite house

There's been a Death, in the Opposite House

There's something quieter than sleep

These are the days when Birds come back

These tested Our Horizon

These—saw Visions

��T

They ask but our Delight

They called me to the Window, for

They dropped like flakes

They have a little Odor—that to me

��T

They have not chosen me, he said,

They leave us with the Infinite

They put Us far apart

They say that "Time assuages"

��T

They say that 'time assuages,

They say that 'time assuages,'--

They Shut Me Up in Prose

They won't frown always—some sweet Day

��T

This Bauble was preferred of Bees

This Chasm, Sweet, upon my life

This Consciousness that is aware

This Dust, and its Feature

This heart that broke so long

This is a Blossom of the Brain

This is My Letter to the World

This is my letter to the world,

This is the land the sunset washes,

This Merit hath the worst

This quiet Dust was Gentleman and Ladies

This Quiet Dust was Gentlemen and Ladies

This that would greet—an hour ago

��T

This was a Poet—It is That

��T

This was in the White of the Year

This World is not Conclusion

This—is the land—the Sunset washes

��T

Tho' I get home how late—how late

��T

Tho' my destiny be Fustian

Those fair—fictitious People

��T

Those who have been in the Grave the longest

Three times—we parted—Breath—and I

��T

Through lane it lay—through bramble

��T

Through the Dark Sod—as Education

��T

Through the strait pass of suffering

Tie the Strings to my Life, My Lord

Tie the strings to my life, my Lord,

Till Death—is narrow Loving

��T

Time feels so vast that were it not

'Tis Anguish grander than Delight

'Tis customary as we part

'Tis good—the looking back on Grief

'Tis little I—could care for Pearls

��'

'Tis not that Dying hurts us so

'Tis One by One—the Father counts

��'

'Tis Opposites—entice

'Tis so appalling—it exhilarates

'Tis so much joy! 'Tis so much joy!

'Tis Sunrise—Little Maid—Hast Thou

'Tis true—They shut me in the Cold

��'

To be alive—is Power

��T

To die

To die—takes just a little while

��T

To fight aloud, is very brave

To fill a Gap

To hang our head—ostensibly

��T

To hear an Oriole sing

To interrupt His Yellow Plan

To know just how He suffered—would be dear

��T

To learn the Transport by the Pain

To lose one's faith—surpass

��T

To love thee Year by Year


To make One's Toilette—after Death

To my quick ear the leaves conferred;

To my quick ear the Leaves—conferred

��T

To my small Hearth His fire came

To offer brave assistance

To One denied the drink

To own the Art within the Soul

To put this World down, like a Bundle

To this World she returned

To venerate the simple days

To wait an Hour—is long

��T

Too little way the House must lie

Train

Triumph—may be of several kinds

��T

Trust in the Unexpected

Truth—is as old as God

��T

'Twas a long Parting—but the time

��'

'Twas awkward, but it fitted me

'Twas Crisis—All the length had passed

��T

'Twas just this time, last year, I died

'Twas like a Maelstrom, with a notch

'Twas Love—not me

Twas such a little—little boat

��T

'Twas the old—road—through pain

��'

'Twas warm—at first—like Us

Twice had Summer her fair Verdure

Two butterflies went out at noon

Two swimmers wrestled on the spar

Two Travellers perishing in Snow

Two—were immortal twice

'Twould ease—a Butterfly

Undue Significance a starving man attaches

Unto my Books—so good to turn

Upon Concluded Lives

Victory comes late

Victory comes late,

Wait till the Majesty of Death

Water, is taught by thirst

We can but follow to the Sun

We Cover Thee—Sweet Face

We do not play on Graves

We don't cry—Tim and I

��W

We dream—it is good we are dreaming

We Grow Accustomed to the Dark

We learned the Whole of Love

We like march, his shoes are purple,

We lose—because we win

��W

We met as Sparks—Diverging Flints

��W

We miss Her, not because We see

We outgrow love like other things

We outgrow love, like other things

We play at Paste

We play at paste,

We pray—to Heaven

We see—Comparatively

We should not mind so small a flower

We talked as Girls do

We thirst at first—'tis Nature's Act

We—Bee and I—live by the quaffing

��W

We'll pass without the parting

Went up a year this evening!

Wert Thou but ill—that I might show thee

What care the Dead, for Chanticleer

What did They do since I saw Them?

What I can do—I will

��W

What I see not, I better see

What if I say I shall not wait!

What Inn is this

What is—"Paradise"

What shall I do when the Summer troubles

What shall I do—it whimpers so

��W

What Soft—Cherubic Creatures

��W

What would I give to see his face?

When Bells stop ringing—Church—begins

��W

When Diamonds are a Legend

When I count the seeds

When I have seen the Sun emerge

When I hoped, I recollect

When I was small, a Woman died

When Katie walks, this simple pair accompany her side

When Night is almost done

When One has given up One's life

When Roses cease to bloom, Sir

When the Astronomer stops seeking

When we stand on the tops of Things

Where bells no more affright the morn

Where I have lost, I softer tread

Where Ships of Purple—gently toss

��W

Where Thou art—that—is Home

��W

Whether my bark went down at sea

��W

While Asters—

While it is alive

Who Court obtain within Himself

Who Giants know, with lesser Men

Who never lost, are unprepared

Who occupies this House?

Whole Gulfs—of Red, and Fleets—of Red

��W

Whose are the little beds, I asked

Whose cheek is this?

Why do I love You, Sir?

Why make it doubt—it hurts it so

��W

Why—do they shut Me out of Heaven?

��W

Wild Nights - Wild Nights!

Wild Nights! Wild Nights!

Wild Nights—Wild Nights!

Will there really be a

Will there really be a "Morning"?

With thee, in the Desert

Within my Garden, rides a Bird

Within my reach!

Without this—there is nought

Wolfe demanded during dying

Woodpecker, The

Would you like summer? Taste of ours

You cannot put a Fire out

You constituted Time

You know that Portrait in the Moon

You left me—Sire—two Legacies

You left me, sweet, two legacies,--

��Y

You love me—you are sure

��Y

You love the Lord—you cannot see

��Y

You said that I

You said that I "was Great"—one Day

You see I cannot see—your lifetime

��Y

You taught me Waiting with Myself

You'll find—it when you try to die

��Y

You'll know Her—by Her Foot

��Y

You'll know it—as you know 'tis Noon

��Y

Your Riches—taught me—Poverty

��Y

You're right—"the way is narrow"

You've seen Balloons set—Haven't You?
